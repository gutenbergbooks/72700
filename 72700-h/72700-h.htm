<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
THE LOVER.
</h3>

<p>
'And you will not accompany me to call on these
ladies, uncle?' said the young man persuasively.
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not, boy; do you take me for a fool&mdash;der
Duyvel!' was the snappish rejoinder, as the General
tossed his silver-mounted meerschaum on the table,
and thrust his chair back on the polished oak floor,
'I have suspected you for some time past, and know,
from old experience, that a young fellow in love is
lost to the service and himself; among women he is
as helpless as a rudderless ship among the thousand
shoals of the Zuyder Zee!  You are my heir, as you
know, provided your conduct and obedience satisfy
me.  I am rich enough for both of us, and I had
begun to hope that, like me, you would go through
the world without the encumbrance of a wife.  I shall
not see you make a fool of yourself, without making
an effort to save you.  I shall give you a Beating
Order, and send you to recruit for the Brigade in
Scotland; or how would you like to roast on detachment
at Guayana, or among the Dutch Isles in the
Caribbean Sea?'
</p>

<p>
'Such a separation would be death to me, and to
Dolores too.'
</p>

<p>
'Dol&mdash;what?' roared the General, grasping the
knobs of his arm-chair and glaring at the speaker;
'how familiar we are, it seems!  Where the devil did
she get that absurd name?'
</p>

<p>
'From a Spanish ancestress, and with the name
much of her beauty,' replied the younger man, who
had a very pleasant voice and manner, which, if
somewhat sad and soft, possessed the charm of
cultured influences and refinement.
</p>

<p>
'Dolores&mdash;a very Donna Dulcinea, no doubt!  Well,
my young cock-o'-the-game, it is useless in me to
repeat what you don't want to hear, and in you to
say the same thing over and over again, as you have
been doing for the last hour.  So far as you and
this&mdash;Dolores are concerned, my mind is made up&mdash;yes,
by the henckers' horns!'
</p>

<p>
The speaker was no Dutchman, as his interjection
might lead the reader to infer, but, like his nephew,
a native of the northern portion of our isle, being
Lieutenant-General John Kinloch, of Thominean in
Fifeshire, Colonel-Commandant of the six battalions
of the Scots Brigade, in the service of their High
Mightinesses the States-General of Holland&mdash;a corps
which boasted itself 'the Bulwark of the Republic'&mdash;a
veteran of more than twenty years' hard service,
though still in the flower of manhood.
</p>

<p>
His hair was powdered and queued, as was then
the fashion; his handsome face was well bronzed by
long exposure to the tropical sun, and his hands,
which had never known gloves, contrasted in their
brown hue with snow-white ruffles of the finest lace
at the wide cuffs of his uniform coat.
</p>

<p>
His nose was straight; his mouth expressed firmness
and decision, and his dark eyes, which were
sparkling then with no small amount of anger, had
somewhat shaggy brows that nearly met in one, and
gave great character to his face.
</p>

<p>
His nephew, who stood near him, playing with the
gold knot of his sword, and trying to deprecate his
anger, was Lewis (or as he was generally called
Lewie) Baronald of that Ilk in Lanarkshire (the only
son of a baronet attainted after Culloden), and now a
handsome young lieutenant in the Earl of
Drumlanrig's Battalion of the Scots Brigade, in quarters,
where we find him, at the Hague.
</p>

<p>
His face wore a droll expression just then, in spite
of himself, as he knew that his uncle and patron was
well known in the Brigade, and in Dutch society, as a
misogynist&mdash;a genuine woman-hater, under the
influence of some never-forgotten disappointment he had
endured in early life, and who never omitted by the
exertion of his advice, influence, or actual authority,
to mar&mdash;if possible&mdash;the matrimonial views and
wishes of the officers and men under his command.
</p>

<p>
When any of his brother officers would venture to
express their surprise that one who was evidently so
good-hearted and warm by nature, and who&mdash;though
in all things a perfect soldier&mdash;was apparently fond of
domestic life, should have omitted to share it with a
help-mate, their remarks only invoked a torrent of
grotesque invectives upon the sex, and put the General
in such exceeding bad humour, that they were glad
to beat a retreat and leave him to himself.
</p>

<p>
He had begun to perceive that for some time past,
his nephew was abstracted in manner, that he
absented himself from his quarters, was rather estranged
from his comrades, and was almost neglectful of his
military duties; and from rumours that reached him
from the idlers and promenaders in the Voorhout
and on the Vyverberg, the General was not long in
discovering that a charming young girl was the cause
of all this, and great was his wrath thereat.  And when
he found that Lewie Baronald's abstraction increased;
that he caught him reading poetry instead of studying
the '<i>Tactique et Discipline dc Prusse</i>'; that he sighed
sometimes involuntarily, and more than once had been
caught inditing suspicious-looking little missives in the
form of delicately folded, tinted and perfumed notes,
he took him finally to task, and his indignation found
vent, as it did on the present occasion.
</p>

<p>
'And you fell in with this girl&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'When our battalion was sharing duty with the
Dutch Guards at the Prince of Orange's palace in
Amsterdam.'
</p>

<p>
'And how about her mother?' growled the General.
</p>

<p>
'She was very averse to my attendance on her
daughter till&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Till when or what?' snapped the uncle.
</p>

<p>
'She asked me some questions concerning my name
and family, and then suddenly I became quite a favourite.'
</p>

<p>
'All cunning&mdash;all cunning!  But our name and our
blood are as good as any in Holland, and better than
some, I suppose; but every Scot has a pedigree, as
King James was wont to say.'
</p>

<p>
And as General Kinloch spoke, the strong old
Scottish accent, which then prevailed at the Bar and
in the Pulpit at home (as it had done at Court in the
preceding century), deepened with his excitement and
irritation.
</p>

<p>
'And the mother is a widow, Drumlanrig tells me,'
he continued; 'a widow who, I doubt not, loves her
coffee with a glass of good curaçoa from De Pylsteeg
at Amsterdam.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed you mistake her, uncle,' replied the young
man indignantly.
</p>

<p>
'Umph&mdash;egad&mdash;do I?'
</p>

<p>
'She often speaks to me of you, uncle.'
</p>

<p>
'Does she?  I am greatly honoured.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;and seems to know all about you, and your
brilliant services to their Mightinesses the States, and
so forth.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil she does!  Well, she probably knows
also that I never was a lady's man&mdash;a lady-killer, a
buck, or a blood in my time; so my lady countess
may spare her breath to cool her porridge.  And <i>who</i>
is this Countess van Renslaer?  Her name sounds
new to me.'
</p>

<p>
'She has but lately come to Holland.'
</p>

<p>
'From where?'
</p>

<p>
'England last, I believe; and none seem to take a
higher place at the Court of the Prince of Orange; at
the balls of the Grand Pensionary, and of the richest
burgers in the Hague and Amsterdam.'
</p>

<p>
'Ouf!  Well, I go to none of them&mdash;not even to
Court, save once a year, to kiss the Prince's hand, and
give in the Brigade Reports.  She has a great
retinue&mdash;keeps a stately coach and two sedans, I hear; and
does this artful old&mdash;countess seem to tolerate
the advances of a penniless sub like you, to her
daughter?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because she is interested in me,' replied Lewie
Baronald, smiling.
</p>

<p>
'For what reason?'
</p>

<p>
'Her first lover had been one of the Scots Brigade,
and her heart still warms to the uniform.'
</p>

<p>
The knitted brow of the General relaxed for a
moment, and he said with a grim smile:
</p>

<p>
'Then there have been two fools at least in the
Brigade, to my knowledge.  And for this prize,
Dolores&mdash;I have caught her absurd name, you
perceive&mdash;have you no rivals&mdash;no competitors?'
</p>

<p>
The young man's brow grew very dark.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said he, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'Many?'
</p>

<p>
'One chiefly.'
</p>

<p>
'Whom you fear??
</p>

<p>
'I fear no man that wears a sword, uncle!  She has
a cousin, called Maurice Morganstjern, whom I greatly
distrust.'
</p>

<p>
'Grandson of that Morganstjern who was one of
the assassins of the De Witts in the last century?
Avoid the whole brood, I say!  If you will not be
guided by me, who have your interest at heart,
consult your Colonel, Drumlanrig, on this matter, and
hear what <i>he</i> will say.'
</p>

<p>
'The last man to consult on such a topic.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Like yourself, he shuns female society.  He is a
gloomy misanthrope, and one of a fated race.'
</p>

<p>
'Right: a curse fell on his house, for the duke's
share in the Union of 1707.  I thought your family
troubles were at an end when you joined the Brigade;
but, der Duyvel! they seem only beginning, with this
Dolores.  To me it appears that there are some
families&mdash;in Scotland more especially&mdash;whom
misfortune&mdash;fate&mdash;which you will&mdash;pursueth to utter
destruction.'
</p>

<p>
'The fate of mine was their own choosing: it lay
between prudence and loyalty, and ill would it have
become my people to have wavered when the Royal
Standard was unfurled in Glenfinnan.'
</p>

<p>
'Your father's views and mine were different in that
matter,' said the General in a softer tone.
</p>

<p>
'Give me your hand.  I do not despair of your
favour for us yet.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'Tyne heart, tyne all, as we say at home.'
</p>

<p>
'In old Scotland, yes&mdash;and before the enemy, that
is well enough; but anent a woman&mdash;go&mdash;go&mdash;or I
shall lose my temper again.  Besides, Lewie, there is
a cloud on the horizon&mdash;the political horizon, I
mean&mdash;which, though as yet no bigger than a man's hand,
may expand into a dark and mighty one of storm
and bloodshed.  A revolution is at hand in France,
and a time is coming when we&mdash;the Scots Brigade&mdash;will
have other work than love-making cut out for us,
and we shall have to choose between casting our lot
forever with the States-General or with his Majesty
George III.; for there is not a tavern and not a
caserne in Holland in which the matter is not debated
keenly and hotly now.'
</p>

<p>
Though the steady opposition and hostility of his
uncle and patron, on whom all his hopes depended,
left the young man depressed in spirit and heavy in
heart, and inspired by no small dread of separation
from the object of his love, he quitted the General's
house, and set forth to visit her.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
THE COLONEL-COMMANDANT.
</h3>

<p>
The General refilled his glass and his meerschaum,
and remained sunk in thought after the departure of
his nephew, and more than once he sighed heavily,
knit his brows, and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
He was not drinking schiedam with water, but good
Farintosh whisky, kegs of which were regularly sent
to him by a Scottish merchant from the Scotsch Dyk
at Rotterdam&mdash;Farintosh which was then free from
all Excise duty, and remained so till five years after
the period of our story.
</p>

<p>
We have said that General Kinloch was a handsome
man and in the flower of manhood; and a fine
picture he would have made as he sat there, in his
graceful old-fashioned uniform, with heavily-laced
lapels and skirts, his hair powdered and queued, with a
Khevenhüller hat (not unlike that of Napoleon I.) close
by, adorned with a stiff upright feather and Dutch
cockade, and his silk sash worn crossways in the old
Scottish fashion.
</p>

<p>
The old Scottish officer who took a turn of service
in France was jaunty in air, tone, and bearing, as
Scott describes his Baron of Bradwardin to have
been; but his countryman who served the States of
Holland became, under the influence of his flat, stale
and stolid surroundings, rather another style of
man&mdash;equally brave and gallant in war, but less gallant
in the ball-room or the boudoir&mdash;often grave, grim,
and starched amid the influence of Dutch society and
Presbyterianism.
</p>

<p>
It was only thirty-four years before that Culloden
had been fought; and though his political sympathies
were not with the exiled King James VIII., his mind
was full of the bitter memories of that atrocious field
left in every right-thinking Scottish heart; and his
orphan nephew, Lewie Baronald, was the son of his
only sister, one of those enthusiastic Jacobite ladies
who kept guard at Edinburgh Cross with a drawn
sword when the King was proclaimed, who danced at
the famous Holyrood ball, and who, like more than
one old lady in Scottish history and tradition, had
never allowed her husband to kiss her, after the Prince
did so, and after making his bed, when an exile and
fugitive, with her own hands, had laid aside the sheets
thereof to be a shroud for herself, in the true spirit of
loyalty 'and that sublime devotion which the Saxon
never knew.'
</p>

<p>
Long as he had been in Holland, the eyes of our
Scot&mdash;accustomed as he had been to the grand
mountain scenery of his native land&mdash;had never become
accustomed to the utter monotony, flatness, and
insipidity of the Dutch landscape, or to the brusqueness
of the natives, their stolidity and general dulness of
demeanour; but the pay was good, the quarters were
comfortable, and&mdash;when not fighting&mdash;the service was
easy enough.  His sword was almost his inheritance,
as the estate he inherited, Thominean, was drowned
in debt; and their High Mightinesses the
States-General were sure and generous paymasters.
</p>

<p>
Yet, times there were when he thought with the
author of 'Vathek,' that there must have been a period
when Holland was all water, 'and the ancestors of
the present inhabitants fish.  A certain <i>oysterishness</i>
of eye and flabbiness of complexion are almost
proof-sufficient of this aquatic descent; and pray tell me for
what purpose are such galligaskins as the Dutch burthen
themselves with contrived, but to tuck up a flouncing
tail, and thus cloak the deformity of a dolphin-like
termination.'
</p>

<p>
Reflecting angrily and sadly upon the recent
conversation with his favourite, the General continued to
smoke and gaze down the long vista of the quaint
Dutch street, with its stiff rows of trees reflected
downward in the canal that lay parallel with them,
and its quaint gables on each of which, nearly, a stork
was perched; the little mirrors projecting from the
windows to enable the ladies within to see those who
passed outside; the knockers tied up with pincushions
and plaited lace to indicate that a 'goodwife was in
the straw.'
</p>

<p>
There were women in the mobcaps, print-gowns, and
gaudy satin aprons wore by all ranks alike; men in
broad, round, conical hats, puckered jackets, and
capacious breeches, now no longer to be seen but in very
remote districts; an occasional dominie or clergyman
in his court-like costume, ruff and cocked hat, passing
homeward after having a pipe with some parishioner,
or a dish of coffee with his vrouw.
</p>

<p>
There was the clatter of wooden shoes in the ill-paved
street; the oil-lamps were beginning to glimmer
like glow-worms, and were reflected in the slime of the
canals; the drums and fifes of the Scots Brigade, in
the adjacent caserne, were playing out the dying day,
and sweetly stole upon the ambient evening the old
air:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh, the Lowlands o' Holland<br>
  Hae parted my love and me;'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
but the General was in shadow-land, thinking of other
times and long-vanished faces, and wondering when
the guilders of their High Mightinesses, and the
prize-money won from the French and Spaniards, would
free his inheritance from all its wadsets and
incumbrances, and he would be able to hang his sword,
where still his father's hung, in the old dining-hall of
Thominean.
</p>

<p>
He saw it in fancy, that old house of Thominean
('the hill of birds'), with its grey crow-stepped gables
and conical pepper-box turrets of the days of James VI.,
overlooked by the green range of the lovely Ochills;
and he laughed softly as he remembered how in boyhood
there he had trembled at the thought of the tiny
elves, who, on their festival nights, were alleged to
make great noises under the green turf, opening and
shutting large chests of gold, and clattering with
goblets and copper kettles; and how still more did he
tremble at the story of a mysterious mirror, in which
occasionally the figure of a pale woman, clad in white,
could be distinctly seen <i>behind</i> the reflection of the
person who stood before the glass, and how it was
said to have appeared therein on the night his beloved
sister, the Lady Baronald, died, and left her only son
penniless in the world.
</p>

<p>
Thus Lewie, in his boyhood, became a soldier.  On
an evening that he never forgot, there came marching
bravely down the quaint High Street of Kinross a
recruiting-party of the Scots Brigade, with ribbons
fluttering, drawn swords gleaming, the shrill pipes and
hoarse drums, making every lane and alley bordering
on Loch Leven to re-echo 'The Lowlands o' Holland;'
and halting in front of the Bruce Arms Inn, a
portly sergeant, after a libation of Farintosh had been
duly poured forth, harangued the gathered rustics.
He invited 'all lads of spirit to join that battalion of
the Scots Brigade, commanded by the noble and
valiant Henry Douglas, Earl of Drumlanrig, under
their High Mightinesses the States-General of Holland,
to fight the frog-eating French and popish Spaniards;
all who so entered to have complete new clothing,
arms and accoutrements as became a gentleman and
soldier, two guineas bounty, and a crown to drink to
the health of their High Mightinesses, and to the
confusion of their enemies!'
</p>

<p>
A loud hurrah and much brandishing of broadswords
followed this invitation, and ere 'The Point of
War' was fully beaten, Lewie Baronald had shaken
hands with this Scottish Sergeant Kite, and had the
Dutch cockade pinned on his blue bonnet by a cunning
corporal, who showed him an old watch like a silver
turnip, and worth half-a-crown, which he boldly
alleged had been presented to him 'by his Royal
Highness the Prince of Orange in person.'
</p>

<p>
His uncle's influence soon procured him 'a pair of
colours,' as the phrase was then, for a commission;
and he soon proved himself worthy of the distinction
by the daring and courage he displayed, when the
battalion of Drumlanrig was employed with other
Dutch troops in 1774, at the Cape of Good Hope, in
driving the natives from the Bokkeveld and Roggeveld,
back into the deserts on the south-west coast of
Africa; and since his return to Holland his name, the
popularity of his regiment, his handsome face and
figure, were equally passports to the best society in
the Hague and at Amsterdam.
</p>

<p>
But now, it seemed to his uncle and patron, the
Colonel-Commandant of the Brigade, that his
prospects were on the point of being marred by this
unlucky passion for the daughter of the Countess
van Renslaer.
</p>

<p>
Kinloch's antipathy to women was well known in
the Brigade, and it was a standing joke among the
battalions, that once, when the coquettish wife of the
Grand Pensionary of Amsterdam had lured him into
a game of battledore and shuttlecock, and contrived
to let the latter drop into her ample bosom, and
pointing thereto, piteously besought the General to
take it out, that he&mdash;obtuse as Uncle Toby with the
Widow Wadman&mdash;deftly abstracted it with the tongs.
</p>

<p>
'The lad will succeed me in time, as Laird of
Thominean,' he muttered, after a time; 'the forfeited
baronetcy may be restored: so why shouldn't he
marry because I&mdash;I&mdash;but better not!  They are all
alike&mdash;all alike, these women: so he will be safer with
the left wing of Dundas's Battalion in the West
Indies, than philandering here at the Hague.'
</p>

<p>
But even while giving utterance to his thoughts, his
features relaxed: his irritation or annoyance seemed
to abate as other thoughts stole into his mind, and a
shade of melancholy came over his face; and resting
his head upon his hands, he remained for a time in
deep and apparently painful thought.
</p>

<p>
Then he rose slowly, and selecting a key from a
small bunch, opened an elaborately-carved Dutch
cabinet, and from a secret drawer thereof, curiously
and ingeniously hidden by a movable lion's head, he
drew forth the oval miniature of a young girl, and
gazed upon it long, sorrowfully, and tenderly.
</p>

<p>
There was something quaint and childlike in the
beauty of the girl depicted there, with a string of
pearls round her white and slender throat.  Her
complexion was clear and pure, her expression innocent,
with golden-brown hair, and golden-brown eyes that
seemed to smile on him again as he gazed on them.
</p>

<p>
A hot tear started in the eyes of Kinloch, yet he
bit his lip, and, as if angry with himself for the
emotion that came over him, he closed the miniature-case
with a sharp snap, and restored it to its place of
concealment hurriedly, muttering:
</p>

<p>
'Fool that I was&mdash;fool that I am now!  Heaven
grant that this Dolores of Lewie's may not make the
dupe of him that girl made of me!  I must save him
from himself.  I shall write the Director-General of
the Forces&mdash;Berbice or Essequibo it must be.  Poor
Lewie!  I am loth to part with him; but, der Duyvel! he
shall not be the victim of this old jade and her
daughter.'
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
SWORD-PLAY.
</h3>

<p>
Full of conflicting thoughts Lewie Baronald, with a
slower pace than usual, proceeded towards the
residence of the Countess van Renslaer, and quitting
the Lang Vourhout, he crossed the canal that
encircles the whole Hague.
</p>

<p>
If compelled by his powerful uncle's eccentric
opposition to act the laggard now, he might
leave Dolores to be won by his rival
Morganstjern!  Such things have been, and may be
again.  His brain whirled and his heart sank at the
thought; and even if he had the permission of the
Director-General of Infantry accorded him, could he
ask the brilliant Dolores to share his solitary room
in the barracks&mdash;the <i>Oranje Caserne</i>&mdash;of the Scots
Brigade?
</p>

<p>
The thought was full of folly and presumption.
He was not quite aware of the full extent of the
hostile&mdash;yet well-meant&mdash;design his uncle the General
was forming, for an effectual separation between him
and the object of his love.  He had left her yesterday
with the avowed intention of obtaining the sanction
of the General, from whom he had a yearly allowance:
and now that the sanction was withheld, he was in
sore perplexity, for by the then rules of the Dutch
service no officer could marry without the consent of
his superior; and how was he to tell Dolores that
this had been bluntly refused, and that even exile or
foreign service menaced him?
</p>

<p>
While these thoughts were passing through his
mind, he came suddenly upon Maurice Morganstjern;
he was seated under one of the trees that bordered
the canal near the Hooge Wal, and was leisurely
polishing the blade of his rapier with his leather glove,
while conversing with a friend.
</p>

<p>
He was rather a handsome but dissipated-looking
young fellow, and had shifty eyes and a very sinister
expression of face.  He wore his sandy-coloured hair
powdered and tied, a smart Nivernois hat (such hats
were all the rage about 1780), small, and with the
flaps fastened up to the brim with hooks and eyes;
his costume was bright in colours and richly
laced.
</p>

<p>
That of his companion was the reverse.  He wore
an old battered Khevenhüller hat; his shaggy hair was
unpowdered; his ruffles were soiled and torn; his
visage was bloated and his eyes bloodshot and watery,
while a scar on his nose, covered by a piece of black
court-plaster, did not add to the respectability of his
appearance: and Lewie Baronald, who knew him to be
the Heer van Schrekhorn, a noted bully, gamester, and
frequenter of gambling-houses and estaminets, barely
accorded him any recognition, though feeling himself
compelled to present his hand to Maurice Morganstjern.
</p>

<p>
'How now, Mynheer&mdash;have you been fighting?'
he inquired laughingly of the latter.
</p>

<p>
'No; only polishing some specks off my sword,'
replied Morganstjern, with a smile on his thin lips,
though there was none in his watery grey eyes; 'but
apropos of fighting&mdash;do you affect that?'
</p>

<p>
'In a proper cause&mdash;yes,' replied Baronald,
surprised by the question.
</p>

<p>
'And can cover yourself well?' continued Morganstjern,
making a half-mock lunge which the other&mdash;with
the quickness of lightning&mdash;parried by his sword
which he instantly drew.
</p>

<p>
'I can cover myself, as you shall see,' he exclaimed;
and they began to fence in jest apparently, while the
Heer looked approvingly on, and said with a laugh
and an oath:
</p>

<p>
'Now we shall see who is the better ruffler of the two.'
</p>

<p>
And the Heer, who bore Lewie no goodwill for the
coldness of his demeanour and the general hauteur
he manifested towards him, looked as if he would
very much have relished to draw his old hanger and
engage in the perilous sport too&mdash;for perilous it was,
with keen-edged and sharply-pointed straight-bladed
swords.
</p>

<p>
The Heer van Schrekhorn was everyway an odious
fellow&mdash;a lover of the fair sex, of schiedam and cards;
but one who always avowed openly that <i>liking</i> for a
woman was one thing, but love for her was another&mdash;and
certes he knew nothing about it.
</p>

<p>
He loudly and bluntly applauded his friend's
fencing.
</p>

<p>
'Appel now!' he exclaimed; 'quick&mdash;disengage to
that side again! contract your arm&mdash;quick&mdash;dart a
thrust right forward now!'
</p>

<p>
At that moment, as if in obedience to the suggestion,
the point of Morganstjern's sword struck the gilded
regimental gorget of Baronald, which was adorned
with the Lion Rampant of the Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
'The devil!' he exclaimed; 'do you aim at my throat?'
</p>

<p>
'All a mistake,' said Morganstjern, beginning to
pant as he was pressed on in turn and driven back.
</p>

<p>
'Is this folly or fury&mdash;do you really wish to quarrel?'
asked Lewie Baronald; but the other made no reply,
though his eyes became inflamed, his colour deepened,
his teeth were set and his brows knit; and though he
laughed, the sound of his laughter was strange and
unnatural.
</p>

<p>
This game at sharps was certainly jest with Baronald,
though he little liked his opponent; but he soon
became aware that the eyes of the latter seemed to
become more bloodshot, that his cheek paled, his
grasp grew firmer on his hilt; that his thrusts came
quickly and fiercely&mdash;in short, that beyond all doubt,
under cover of a little pretended sword-play, he
had&mdash;murder in his heart!
</p>

<p>
They were rivals for the love of Dolores, yet
Morganstjern had not the courage to challenge Baronald
to a regular mortal duel.  His bearing now, and the
perilous thrust arrested by his gorget, were a warning
to the latter of that which Morganstjern was now
capable&mdash;killing him by design, without peril to
himself, while he would affect that it was done by mere
chance in rough jest; and had Baronald been run
through the body, the Heer would have been ready to
affirm and swear that it was all done by the merest
accident.
</p>

<p>
Baronald felt his blood getting warm; he knew
that duelling was sternly discouraged by the Dutch
authorities; and that to kill the cousin of Dolores,
even in self-defence, would preclude all chance of
possessing her favour.
</p>

<p>
But a strong measure was absolutely necessary.
Darting forward he suddenly locked-in&mdash;seized his
adversary's sword-arm, by twining his left arm round
it, thus closing his parade hilt to hilt, and disarmed
him by literally wrenching his sword from his
grasp.
</p>

<p>
Pale as death now, panting, and with eyes flashing
fire, Morganstjern stood before the victor, who,
presenting the captured sword by the blade, said, with a
kind of smile:
</p>

<p>
'This rough play is being carried too far&mdash;here let
it end.'
</p>

<p>
Hissing out some execration, Morganstjern took his
sword by the hilt, and in the blind excesss of his fury
would have plunged it into the breast of Baronald,
but at the moment it was struck up by another sword,
as two officers of the Scots Brigade, Francis, Lord
Lindores, and the Master of Dumbarton, threw
themselves between them.
</p>

<p>
'We do but jest, gentlemen,' said Morganstjern,
lifting his hat and sheathing his sword.
</p>

<p>
'Is this true, Baronald?' asked Lord Lindores.
</p>

<p>
'Jest assuredly, so far as I am concerned,' replied
Lewie.
</p>

<p>
'I must confess that the work looked remarkably
like earnest, so far as your adversary was concerned,'
remarked the Master of Dumbarton, with a look at
Morganstjern which there was no mistaking; but the
latter simply bowed, and saying:
</p>

<p>
'Gentlemen&mdash;your servant.  I have the honour to
bid you good evening.'
</p>

<p>
Then, accompanied by the Heer van Schrekhorn,
he hastened away; leaving Baronald to explain the
matter as he chose to his two brother-officers, who
had some difficulty in making him really aware of the
deadly risk he had run.
</p>

<p>
'He is gone like a man who has lost an hour and
runs as if to overtake it,' said Lord Lindores.  'Now how
came you, Lewie Baronald, to be fencing, even in
jest, with rufflers such as these?'
</p>

<p>
Baronald could not explain that one of them was
the cousin of Dolores.
</p>

<p>
'At the Kanongietery we have just parted with
Van Otterbeck, the Minister of State.  It is as well he
did not accompany us and see that piece of folly,
Baronald; it might have gone hard with you, as the
Brigade is not greatly in favour just now,' said the
Master of Dumbarton, who was James Douglas,
grandson of the loyal and gallant Earl of that title,
who was Colonel of the Royal Scots, and followed
James VII. into exile.
</p>

<p>
He was tall, had a straight nose, the bold dark
eyes of the Douglas race, and sunny brown hair tied
behind with a black ribbon and rosette.
</p>

<p>
'True,' added Lord Lindores; 'and I begin to
think the Brigade has had enough and to spare of
Holland during these two hundred years past, fighting
to defend lazy boors and greedy merchants, in a land
of frowsy fogs and muddy canals; as Butler has it in
"Hudibras:"
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '"A land that rides at anchor, and is moored;<br>
  In which they do not live, but go aboard."'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
These remarks referred to the growing discontent
between the regiments of the Brigade and the
States-General&mdash;matters to which we may have to refer
elsewhere, and which led to the former abandoning
the service of the latter for that of Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
And now Lewie Baronald, after thanking his friends
for their intervention and advice, took the road to the
residence of the Countess van Renslaer, whither,
unknown to him, Morganstjern had preceded him,
and was, at that very moment, engaged with Dolores.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0104"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
DOLORES.
</h3>

<p>
The villa occupied by the Countess van Renslaer
stood a little distance from the Hague, on the Ryswick
road, amid a large pleasure-garden in the old Dutch
style, a marvel of prettiness, with its meandering
walks, fantastically-cut parterres, box borders, pyramids
of flower-pots, and tiny fish-pond where the carp
and perch were often fed by the white hands of
Dolores.
</p>

<p>
It had more than one rose-bowered <i>zomerhuis</i>
hidden among the shrubbery, and admirably adapted
for contemplation or flirtation.  It was the month of
May now, when the tulips and hyacinths, potted in
<i>jardinières</i> full of light sand, were in all their
beauty&mdash;flowers for which, in the days of the <i>tulip-mania</i>, a
hundred florins had been paid for a single bulb.
</p>

<p>
Around, the country was intersected in every
direction by canals and trees in long straight avenues,
the level surface dotted with farms and summer-houses;
an occasional steeple, the old castle where the
famous Treaty of Ryswick was signed, and the sails of
many windmills whirling slowly in the evening breeze,
alone broke the flat monotony of the Dutch horizon.
</p>

<p>
In the deep recess of a window that opened to the
garden sat Dolores, watching and expectant.  But
only that morning, after parade, Lewie Baronold had
talked to her of love&mdash;his love and hers&mdash;in the recess
of that window&mdash;talked so sweetly of his adoration of
her own charming self.  So Dolores had thought to
sit there again, with eyes half closed and smiling lips,
to think it all over once more, while fanning herself
with one of the large fans of green silk then in fashion,
while the Countess, her mother, had fallen asleep
over 'Clélia,' one of Monsieur de Scudery's
five-volume folio novels, in the drawing-room beyond.
</p>

<p>
Dolores was taller, more lithe and slender, than
Dutch girls usually are, for she had in her veins the
blood of more than one ancestor who had come with
that scourge of the Low Countries, Ferdinand of
Toledo, <i>el castigador del Flamencas</i>; hence her graceful
figure, the stately carriage of her beautiful head,
her rather aquiline and oval features, her dark hair,
and the darker lashes that shaded her soft eyes that
were 'like violets bathed in dew,' and hence her
peculiar name of Dolores.
</p>

<p>
She had the bloom of Holland in her cheek, and the
grace of Spain in her carriage and bearing.  An
exquisite costume of pale yellow silk became the
brunette character of her beauty well; creamy lace
fell away in folds from the snowy arms it revealed;
perfume, brilliance, and softness were about her.
</p>

<p>
There was a step on the gravel; her colour deepened.
</p>

<p>
'Morganstjern&mdash;Cousin Maurice!' she muttered with
a tone of annoyance, as he approached her with hat in
hand.
</p>

<p>
Would this creature, so incomparably lovely and
winning, ever belong to him, and lie in his bosom? he
was thinking as he surveyed her; was she not rather
drifting away from him, and would soon, unless he
took strong and sure measures with yonder accursed
Schottlander, be lost to him and his world for ever?
</p>

<p>
'Always becomingly dressed, Dolores,' said he,
stooping over her; 'but this costume especially suits
your style of loveliness.'
</p>

<p>
'You must not say such things to me,' she replied
with some asperity.
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'I mean such pretty or complimentary things,
Maurice Morganstjern; because if you do&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'I shall think that I have forfeited your friendship.'
</p>

<p>
'Friendship!' said he gloomily; 'how long will
you seem to misunderstand me?'
</p>

<p>
Try as she might, Dolores could not feel kindly
or well disposed towards her cousin Morganstjern, and
her replies to him always sounded cold and formal, or
taunting even to herself; and the face that bent over
her was, she knew, not a good one, but sinister, and
expressive of a bad and evil spirit within.
</p>

<p>
And now, as a somewhat palpable hint that his
conversation wearied or worried her, she took up her
flageolet, and putting the ivory mouthpiece to her
rosy lips, began to play a sweet little air, while his
brow became darker, for this now obsolete instrument
(which had silver stops like the old English flute) had
been a gift of Lewie Baronald's, who, in the gallantry
of the day, had inserted a copy of verses addressed to
herself, and which, of course, would only be found
when the instrument was unscrewed to discover what
marred its use.
</p>

<p>
Anon she paused; Maurice Morganstjern then
glanced towards the Countess, and perceiving that she
still slept, drew nearer to Dolores, and lowering his
voice, said:
</p>

<p>
'Can you not love me a little, cousin?'
</p>

<p>
'Not as you wish,' she replied.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
The musical voice of Dolores broke into a soft
little laugh as she fanned herself, and said:
</p>

<p>
'Simply because one cannot love two persons at
once.'
</p>

<p>
'Meaning that you love this&mdash;this accursed
Schottlander?' he hissed through his set teeth.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Maurice! how can you be so rude as to speak
thus of any visitor of mamma's!'
</p>

<p>
'Listen to me, Cousin Dolores,' he resumed, making
a prodigious effort to be calm.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' asked the girl, with something of petulance.
</p>

<p>
'I am probably to be sent to Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed&mdash;for what purpose?'
</p>

<p>
'In the interests of the patriots here.'
</p>

<p>
'And against the Prince of Orange?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;of course.'
</p>

<p>
'You are unwise to say this to me even, cousin.'
said she, looking up now.
</p>

<p>
'But you, Dolores, are my second self.'
</p>

<p>
'What will you do when I go?'
</p>

<p>
'Much the same as I did before you honoured the
Hague with your presence.'
</p>

<p>
'To me it seems that you care little whether you
see me or not.'
</p>

<p>
'What then?&mdash;and it may be so.  Cousin Maurice,
you are always annoying me by love-making, or
by scowling and taunting me about gentlemen
visitors.'
</p>

<p>
'May I hope, however, that you will pay me the
compliment of feeling my absence&mdash;of missing me a
little?'
</p>

<p>
'That,' replied the provoking beauty, as an arch
expression stole into her face, 'may depend upon
what amuses or interests me.  Oh, pardon me,
Maurice&mdash;I am so rude!' she added, on perceiving the
sombre fury expressed by his sinister face.
</p>

<p>
'Whatever you think, only say that you will be sorry
when I go,' he urged.
</p>

<p>
'If you do go&mdash;which I don't believe&mdash;I will be
sorry of course, Maurice,' she replied, as she saw the
necessity of temporising a little; 'I am always so
when I lose anyone or anything that has become
familiar to me.  Do you not remember how I wept
when my poor Bologna spaniel died last year?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not expect you to weep for me.  It would be
too much for Maurice Morganstjern to expect to be
raised to the level of your spaniel.'
</p>

<p>
'How sarcastic and unpleasant you are!' exclaimed
Dolores, expectant of Lewie Baronald's arrival, and
now half dreading that event.  'I wish you would be
as faithful as that poor animal was, and as unselfish in
your love.'
</p>

<p>
'Could you look into my heart, you would find but
one word&mdash;one idea stamped there.'
</p>

<p>
'And that is&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'"Dolores"&mdash;meaning sorrow and lamentation if
you love me not.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed merrily again, and again the sombre
look came into his face; so she dropped her fan and
held out two small white hands as if to deprecate his
wrath, for she had an energetic way with her, so he
instantly caught them in his own.
</p>

<p>
She was quite occupied in trying to release them
when a familiar rap was heard on the knocker of the
street door, an enormous lion's head of brass, with a
huge ring in its jaws.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I keep your hands prisoners,' said he: 'pardon
me,' he added, as he stooped and kissed them; and
she had barely time to wrench them away when a
liveried valet ushered in Lewie Baronald, and in spite
of herself and the presence of her cousin she could
not conceal the joy with which his presence inspired
her.
</p>

<p>
'Welcome,' she said, and held forth her hand.  Oh,
what a hand he thought it&mdash;small, plump, and
white&mdash;so slim and shapely!
</p>

<p>
There was neither shyness, coquetry, nor embarrassment
in the girl's manner, for in their assured position
with each other both she and her lover were long
past anything of the kind; but the latter and her cousin
bowed rather grimly to each other, and mutually
muttered:
</p>

<p>
'Your servant&mdash;Mynheer.'
</p>

<p>
Lewie Baronald now crossed the polished floor of
the drawing-room to greet the Countess, who rose to
receive him, and who looked so young and so pretty
that she might have passed for an elder sister of
Dolores; and stooping low he kissed her hand, looking,
as he did so, with his sword at his side under the stiff
square skirt of his coat, and his hat under his arm,
with his ruffles and cravat of fine lace, a model of
those stately manners that lingered in Europe when
George III. was King&mdash;in Scotland, perhaps, longer
than anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
Of Morganstjern's privileges as a cousin, Lewie
Baronald was never jealous in the least; but on this
occasion, after the recent fencing-bout, the interview
with his uncle, and the threat of service in the Dutch
West Indies, his brow was rather cloudy, and he
longed intensely to be with Dolores alone.
</p>

<p>
The rough sword-play that had been forced upon
him, the risk he had run, and the treachery of
Morganstjern, had certainly exasperated him; but courtesy
to Dolores and the Countess made him dissemble,
and he treated his rival and enemy, if rather coldly
and haughtily, as if nothing remarkable had occurred
between them, and the conversation became of a
general kind.  But Morganstjern, in the waspishness
of his nature, could not help referring to the 'armed
neutrality,' as it was termed, a vexed and then
dangerous political subject for a Briton and a Hollander to
discuss.
</p>

<p>
This was an alliance, offensive and defensive, which
had been formed by some of the northern powers of
Europe; and some violent disputes between Britain
and the States-General, which seemed advancing to a
direct rupture just then, caused the position of the
Scots Brigade in their service to become somewhat
peculiar and critical.
</p>

<p>
From the commencement of the disturbance with
America, the Dutch had maintained a close correspondence
with the revolted colonists, supplying them
with all kinds of material and warlike stores; and
after the interference of France and Spain, the selfishness
and treachery of the Dutch became more glaring
and apparent.
</p>

<p>
'The States-General of Holland are free, independent,
and can do precisely as they choose,' said
Morganstjern haughtily, in reply to some
condemnatory remark of Lewie Baronald.
</p>

<p>
'Their Highnesses,' replied the latter calmly, 'have
no right to leave their ports open to the King's rebels,
in disregard of friendship and honour, and in defiance
of the remonstrances of his ambassadors.'
</p>

<p>
'Permit me to dispute your right, as a soldier in
the service of their Highnesses, to censure them.'
</p>

<p>
Baronald's nether lip quivered at this retort, and
the Countess and Dolores exchanged glances of
uneasiness; for politics had become so embittered
by the American Squadron, which had recently
captured H.M.'s ships <i>Serapis</i> and <i>Scarborough</i>, having
taken them into the Texel, and when General Yorke
claimed those ships and their crews, the Dutch
refused to restore them, and soon after Commodore
Fielding fired upon their squadron under Count
Bylandt, and took him into Portsmouth; so war was
looked for daily, while the Scots Brigade were yet
serving under the Dutch colours.
</p>

<p>
'Do not let us think or speak of such things, Cousin
Maurice,' said Dolores imploringly; 'I tremble at the
idea of Britain invading us, if this sort of work goes
on.  What have we to do with her colonists and
their quarrels?'
</p>

<p>
'Invade us, indeed!' said Morganstjern, with angry
mockery; 'if our swords fail us we can open the
sluices, as we did in the days of Louis XIV., and
drown every man and mother's son!'
</p>

<p>
'But how should we escape ourselves?' asked the
Countess.
</p>

<p>
'Good generalship would take care of that; and
then how about your Scots Brigade?' asked
Morganstjern, turning abruptly to Baronald.
</p>

<p>
'The Bulwark of Holland, we have never failed her
yet,' replied the latter haughtily; 'but to draw the
sword upon our own countrymen is certainly a matter
for consideration.'
</p>

<p>
'In Holland, perhaps, but not in America.'
</p>

<p>
'Let this subject cease,' said the Countess imperatively,
while fanning herself with an air of excessive
annoyance; and now Morganstjern, beginning to find
himself <i>de trop</i>, bowed himself out, and with vengeance
gathering in his heart, withdrew to an estaminet, or
tavern, where he knew that he would find his friend
the Heer van Schrekhorn, and whither we may
perhaps follow him.
</p>

<p>
To Lewie Baronald, who was naturally destitute of
much personal vanity, it had hitherto seemed rather
strange that the Countess had permitted his attentions
to her daughter at all, though he was known to
be the heir of his uncle; and now that he had all the
joy of knowing himself to be her accepted lover, his
soul trembled within him at the prospect of having
to announce General Kinloch's utter hostility to the
mother.
</p>

<p>
Lewie had more than once observed that the
Countess always smiled, or laughed outright, when
his uncle the General was spoken of, as if she
considered him somewhat of a character&mdash;an <i>excentrique</i>.
</p>

<p>
'You have seen the General, I presume, since you
were here last?' said she.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, madam,' replied Lewie, painfully colouring.
</p>

<p>
'And told him of your love for Dolores&mdash;of your
engagement to her, in fact?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, madam; he seems to have suspected it for
some time past.'
</p>

<p>
'Suspected&mdash;that sounds unpleasant.'
</p>

<p>
Lewie played with the feather in his regimental
hat, and his colour deepened, when the Countess said:
</p>

<p>
'Then he is coming to wait upon me, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
'Alas&mdash;no, madam.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'He is averse to the society of ladies.'
</p>

<p>
'In fact, is a woman-hater, I have heard.'
</p>

<p>
Lewie smiled feebly, and felt himself in a foolish
predicament; so the Countess spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'He had some disappointment in early life, I
believe, and never got over it.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, madam.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor fellow! and of Dolores&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'He will not hear me speak with patience.'
</p>

<p>
'How grotesque!' exclaimed the Countess, laughing
heartily.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, could he but see her!' exclaimed the young
man, regarding the upturned face of her he loved
with something of adoration.
</p>

<p>
'Your uncle the General is very cruel, Lewie,' said
Dolores; 'he is a veritable ogre!'
</p>

<p>
'He is the king of good fellows, but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But what?'
</p>

<p>
'He has never seen you.'
</p>

<p>
'And never shall,' she said petulantly, opening and
shutting her fan.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, dearest Dolores, do not say so.'
</p>

<p>
'The ogre, or worse!' exclaimed the girl, with a
pout on her sweet lips.
</p>

<p>
'Nay&mdash;no worse&mdash;only a man,' said the Countess,
laughing excessively; 'he thinks of us only as
women, but to be shunned&mdash;avoided&mdash;dreaded.  It is
very droll!'
</p>

<p>
And looking down, she played with the <i>étui</i> and
appendages that hung from her girdle, her tiny watch
with the judgment of Solomon embossed on its case;
and as she did so, Lewie thought her hand as white
and dimpled as that of Dolores.
</p>

<p>
To him it certainly seemed strange that the
opposition of his uncle seemed only to provoke&mdash;not the
pride or the indignation of the lively Countess&mdash;but
her laughter and amusement.
</p>

<p>
'And if he gets me banished on foreign service
to the Dutch West Indies!' he urged rather
piteously.
</p>

<p>
'My poor Lewie,' said she, patting his cheek with
her fan, 'I must see what can be done; meantime,
we must be patient and wait.  From all I have heard
and know, an early disappointment at the hands of
one he loved only too well, has shaken his faith in
human goodness and integrity, and now he is soured,
suspicious and sarcastic.'
</p>

<p>
'But only so far as women are concerned.'
</p>

<p>
'True; and I suppose he is like a French writer,
who says that "of all serious things, marriage is the
most ridiculous;" but men are not infallible, especially
men like your uncle the General&mdash;<i>errare humanum
est</i>.  Let us be patient a little, and all will come right
in the end.'
</p>

<p>
But Dolores and her lover would only sigh a little
impatiently as her hand stole into his, and the twilight
of evening deepened around them.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
'THE BULWARK OF HOLLAND.'
</h3>

<p>
And now while the lovers are waiting in hope, while
the General is 'nursing his wrath to keep it warm,'
and determined upon their separation; and while
Maurice Morganstjern is plotting what mischief he
may work them, we shall briefly tell the story of the
Scots Brigade, and how it came to be called 'the
Bulwark of Holland.'
</p>

<p>
Lewie Baronald, his uncle the General, and all
others belonging to the Scots Brigade, had a good right
to be proud of doing so, as it had a glorious inheritance
of military history, second only to that of the
1st Royal Scots; and though its memory should have
been immortal, its records now lie rotting in a garret
of the Town House of Amsterdam; and even in
Scotland little is remembered of it, save its march:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The Lowlands o' Holland<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hae parted my love and me.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Yet the drums of that Brigade have stirred the
echoes of every city and fortress between the mouths
of the Ems in the stormy North Sea, and the oak
forests of Luxembourg and the Ardennes; and
between the ramparts of Ostend and the banks of
the Maese and Rhine.
</p>

<p>
In 1570 the fame of Maurice, Prince of Nassau,
drew to his standard many of those Scots whose
swords were rendered idle by peace with England,
and it was by their aid chiefly, that he drove out his
Spanish invaders.  Among those who took with
them the bravest men of the Borders, were that Sir
Walter Scott of Buccleugh who exasperated Queen
Elizabeth by storming the Castle of Carlisle; his son
Walter, the first Earl of Buccleugh; Sir Henry
Balfour of Burleigh; Preston of Gourton; Halkett
of Pitfiran, and other commanders, named by Grose,
Stewart, Hay, Douglas, Graham, and Hamilton.
</p>

<p>
These formed the original Scots Brigade in the
army of Holland, and some of the battalions must
have been kilted, as Famiano Strada, the Jesuit,
states that at the battle of Mechlin they fought
'naked'&mdash;<i>nudi pugnant Scoti multi</i>.
</p>

<p>
In 1594, on the return of the States ambassadors,
whither they had gone to congratulate James VI. on
the birth of his son, they took back with them 1,500
recruits for the Brigade, which five years after fought
valiantly in repelling the Spaniards at the siege of
Bommel.
</p>

<p>
The year 1600 saw its soldiers cover themselves
with glory at the great battle of the Downs, near
Nieuport, and in the following year at the siege of
Ostend, which lasted three years, and in which
100,000 men are said to have perished on both sides,
and where so many of Spinola's bullets 'stuck in the
sandhill bulwark that it became like a wall of iron,
and dashed fresh bullets to pieces when they hit it;'
and so great was the valour of the Brigade at the
siege of Bois-le-Duc, that Frederick Henry, Prince of
Orange, styled it 'The Bulwark of the Republic.'
</p>

<p>
It consisted then of three battalions&mdash;those of
Buccleugh, Scott, and Halkett.
</p>

<p>
The bestowal of some commissions on Dutch officers
caused much discontent during the time of the Prince
of Orange, afterwards William III., with whom (after
being demanded by James VII. without effect in 1688)
the Brigade came over to Britain for a time, and
</p>

<p>
served at the siege of Edinburgh Castle and the battle
of Killiecrankie.
</p>

<p>
In 1747, by the slaughter at Val and the terrible
siege of Bergen-op-Zoom, the Brigade was reduced to
only 330 men, but the <i>Hague Gazette</i> records how they
drove the French from street to street, and of all the
glory won thus, the greatest fell to two lieutenants
named Maclean, the sons of the Laird of Torloisk,
who were complimented by Count Lowendhal, who
commanded the enemy, by whom they were taken.
</p>

<p>
The men of the Brigade were ever good soldiers,
yet strict and God-fearing Presbyterians, who would
rather have had their peccadilloes known to a stern
General like Kinloch, than to the regimental chaplain.
</p>

<p>
And it might be said of this Brigade, as it used to
be said of the Scots Greys, that the members of it
retained a kind of regimental dialect coeval with the
days of its formation, when the language was rather
different from the present Scotch; so, in the Irish
brigades of France and Spain the strongest and
purest old Irish was found to the last.
</p>

<p>
As a sequel to this brief account of the Brigade in
Holland, we may sum up the story of its service in
the British army&mdash;though that service was
brilliant&mdash;in little more than a paragraph.
</p>

<p>
After a long and angry correspondence between the
Governments of Holland and Britain, the Brigade&mdash;save
some fifty officers who had formed ties in Holland,
or elected to remain there&mdash;was transferred to the
service of the latter, when a rupture took place
between them at the time of the American War, and
was taken to Edinburgh, clad in the Dutch
uniform, and about 1794, it adopted the red coat, and
there in George's Square, when drawn up under
Generals Dundas and Kinloch, received its new
colours at the hands of the Scottish Commander-in-Chief,
when it was numbered as the 94th Regiment;
and under these colours it fought gallantly at
Seringapatam, winning the elephant as a badge; at the
storming of Ciudad Rodrigo, and in all the battles of
the Peninsular War, after which it was disbanded at
Edinburgh in 1818.
</p>

<p>
Then another 94th was embodied five years afterwards,
on which occasion, as we tell in our novel, 'The
King's own Borderers,' 'the green standard of the old
Brigade of immortal memory was borne through the
streets from the Castle of Edinburgh by a soldier of
the Black Watch,' thus identifying the new regiment
with the old; but now even the number of the
former has passed away, as under the new and helplessly
defective army organisation scheme, it is muddled
up with the 88th Regiment under a new name.
</p>

<p>
And now, having told what the 'Bulwark of Holland'
was, we shall return to the fortunes of Lewie
Baronald and his <i>fiancée</i> Dolores.
</p>

<p><a id="chap0106"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
AT THE GOLDEN SUN.
</h3>

<p>
'So&mdash;so! this Scottish adventurer stands between me
and the girl I love; between me and my own flesh
and blood; more than all, between me and the fortune
of Dolores!' muttered Morganstjern&mdash;himself a
penniless adventurer and knave to boot, as he strode
through the streets with his left hand in the hilt of his
sword and his right tightly clenched.  'I have a right
to hate and dread him&mdash;the right to remove him, too,
by fair means or foul!'
</p>

<p>
The latter were the only means he could think of,
as he had a wholesome dread of Lewie Baronald's
skill with his sword, and the bucks of the Scots
Brigade were not wont to stand on trifles when they
resorted to that weapon; and in this mood of mind
he rejoined his friend the Heer van Schrekhorn, whom
he found at an estaminet called the <i>Gond Zon</i>, or
'Golden Sun,' in a narrow and gloomy street near the
Klooster Kerk.
</p>

<p>
There he found him seated in a quiet corner,
smoking, drinking schiedam and water, while intently
studying some profitable and useful gambling tricks
with a pack of not overclean cards.
</p>

<p>
'I have just been trying some ruses or tricks at
lansquenet,' said he, as the tapster brought fresh
glasses and more liquor; 'it is the grandest of old
gambling games, like those that are of French origin.
Look here, to begin with: the cards being shuffled by
the dealer, and cut by one of the party, two are dealt
out and turned up on the left hand of the dealer, <i>so</i>;
he then takes one and places a fourth, the <i>réjouissance</i>
card, in the middle of the table, <i>so</i>.  On this&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Enough of this, Van Schrekhorn,' said Morganstjern
impatiently.  'I did not come here to be taught
lansquenet,' he added, as he threw his sword, hat, and
gloves on a side-table, and flung himself wearily into
a chair.
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;so you have just come from the house of <i>la
belle</i> Dolores?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied the other with an imprecation.
</p>

<p>
'And left her well and happy, I hope?' said the
Heer mockingly.
</p>

<p>
I left her with that fellow of the Scots Brigade.'
</p>

<p>
''Sdeath! the more fool you.  Why not keep your
ground?  Were you not there before him?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, and did my best to win her favour&mdash;even her
mere regard.'
</p>

<p>
'In vain?'
</p>

<p>
'As usual.  In fact, I think these two are affianced&mdash;or
nearly so.  I never so bestirred myself about a
woman before,' said Morganstjern, as he drank at a
draught a crystal goblet of schiedam and water, and
refilled it.
</p>

<p>
'How is the Countess affected towards you?'
</p>

<p>
'But indifferently.  Indeed, she only tolerates me
as a kinsman, and, I suppose, has encouraged or
permitted Baronald's addresses to her daughter, because
he is the heir of General Kinloch, while I am heir to
that only of which nothing can deprive me.'
</p>

<p>
'And that is?'
</p>

<p>
'A grave&mdash;six feet of earth,' replied Morganstjern,
grinding his teeth unpleasantly.
</p>

<p>
'Come&mdash;you have always the guilders you win at
roulette.'
</p>

<p>
'Because they are so won, there is the greater
necessity that I should have those of my cousin
Dolores.'
</p>

<p>
'Which also reminds me that you owe me a good
sum of money&mdash;cash lent, and lost at play.'
</p>

<p>
'Why the devil remind me of that just now?'
replied, or rather asked, Morganstjern, savagely; and
then for a little time the two smoked moodily in
silence.
</p>

<p>
The would-be lover of Dolores had long been
subjected to a run of evil fortune at the gaming-table.
'So long as there is the beacon of hope,' says a writer,
'life is able to show up a gleam now and then of
rose-colour; but when adverse circumstances render
any change <i>impossible</i>, life becomes intolerable.'  And
to this verge of desperation had Maurice Morganstjern come.
</p>

<p>
It was a source of keen irritation to him, to find
that his rival&mdash;favoured by the Countess&mdash;could be
with Dolores daily, while he&mdash;her cousin&mdash;could only
visit her at stated times; and that all the advances he
made to her seemed utterly futile and hopeless now.
</p>

<p>
'Nearly penniless as I am, Schrekhorn,' said he; 'I
might have waited patiently, but have never had a
gleam of hope.'
</p>

<p>
'If you waited a hundred years, it would be all the
same, while she is under the influence of this fellow's
voice, eye, and society.'
</p>

<p>
'What would you have me do?'
</p>

<p>
'Remove him, or remove her!' replied Schrekhorn
with a fierce Dutch oath.
</p>

<p>
'More easily said than done.  With her money, by
the henckers! how I should enjoy myself all day long
and do nothing!'
</p>

<p>
'About all you ever cared to do,' rejoined his friend,
who was rather disposed to treat him mockingly.
</p>

<p>
'Don't attempt to act my Mentor.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I should make but a sorry Telemachus.'
</p>

<p>
'Then it seems all a settled thing between them!'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'How dull you are!  Marriage?'
</p>

<p>
'Ach Gott! it looks like it.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you have been a trifle late of taking the
field?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay,' replied Morganstjern, smoking his meerschaum
with vicious energy.  'I was the first, but
when this fellow Baronald came, I found myself
instantly at a discount.'
</p>

<p>
'Jilted&mdash;eh?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, I was never on such a footing with her that
she could treat me so, because she was ever utterly
indifferent.'
</p>

<p>
'Then it is too late for fair means now, but not for
foul.'
</p>

<p>
Then, after a pause, the Heer said in his mocking
tone;
</p>

<p>
'If money is your object, and you openly avow that
it is so, why not propose to the mother, if the daughter
won't have you?  She is rich enough and certainly
handsome enough, and only some fifteen years older
than yourself.  She is a widow, and all the world
knows how easily widows are won.  'Sblood! cut in
for her, and leave the girl to the Scot.'
</p>

<p>
Morganstjern thought for a minute, and then
uttering one of his imprecations, added:
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;<i>no</i>&mdash;NO!  I shall be thwarted by no man!'
</p>

<p>
'Right!' exclaimed the other; 'I like this
spirit&mdash;give me your hand.'
</p>

<p>
'This infernal Scots Brigade has married at the
Hague and Amsterdam more than fifty Dutch girls
within the last few years, and all of them rich.'
</p>

<p>
'Der Duyvel!'
</p>

<p>
'Many of them girls of the first rank.'
</p>

<p>
'Thousand duyvels!' said the Heer with a mocking
laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Is it not enough that these Scots&mdash;the Bulwark of
the Republic as they boast themselves&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And have done so since the old siege of
Bois-le-Duc&mdash;well?' asked the Heer.
</p>

<p>
'Is it not enough, I say, that they should assume
our glory in war, and win our guilders in peace, but
they must carry off our prettiest girls too?'
</p>

<p>
'They do not assume your glory, but win their own,'
said the Heer, who had some contempt for his
companion; 'their guilders have been hardly won on
many a Dutch and Flemish battlefield; and if the
pretty girls of Haarlem and the Hague prefer them
to Walloons, they are right.'
</p>

<p>
Morganstjern's brow grew black.
</p>

<p>
'I am no Walloon,' said he, huskily.
</p>

<p>
'I did not say so,' said Van Schrekhorn; then he
added, 'I have some news for you, and a hint to
make thereon.  Dolores van Renslaer is to be at the
ridotto given by the wife of the Sixe van Otterbeck,
the Minister of State, on the night after next.'
</p>

<p>
'That I know, and of course this pestilent Scot will
be there too.'
</p>

<p>
'No; on that night he is on duty at the Palace of
the Prince of Orange.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;what about all this?'
</p>

<p>
'Listen,' said Van Schrekhorn, leaning forward on
the table and lowering his voice almost to a whisper,
while the colour in his bloated visage deepened, and
an expression of intense cunning stole into his watery
bloodshot eyes: 'let us carry her off as her sedan
bears her from the ridotto!'
</p>

<p>
'To where?'
</p>

<p>
'Listen.  I know a skipper whose ship is now in
the Maese, and almost ready to sail for the coast of
France.  She is anchored off Maesluis now; let us
once get her on board and the Hoek van Holland
will soon be left astern, and the girl your own, unless
you are a greater fool than I think you.'
</p>

<p>
Morganstjern made no immediate reply, so his
tempter spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'Once on board that ship, her honour will be
compromised, and marriage alone can restore it.  Let her
be once on board that ship with you, I say, and she
cannot be so blind as not to see that she will have
gone a great deal too far to draw back.'
</p>

<p>
'Right!' exclaimed Morganstjern, as a glance of
triumph came into his eyes.  'I have a political
mission to France, and it will be supposed that she
has eloped with me, and befooled the Scot Baronald.
With all her contempt and scorn of me, she little
knows that her fate is to become my wife&mdash;my
wife&mdash;<i>mine</i>!  Once that, and then let her look to herself!'
he added as a savage expression mingled with the
triumph that sparkled in his shifty eyes, and he
smote the table with his clenched hand.
</p>

<p>
'The distance from the Hague to Maesluis is only
eleven miles&mdash;a few pipes, as the people say,' resumed
Schrekhorn; 'my friend shall have a boat waiting
us at a quiet spot among the willows that fringe the
shore, near a deserted windmill on the river-bank;
and then we shall take her on board.  Once under
hatches, her fate will soon be sealed.'
</p>

<p>
'How can I thank you?'
</p>

<p>
'By refunding what you owe me out of the guilders
of Dolores,' replied the Heer, as he and Morganstjern
shook hands again; but the latter became silent for a
time.
</p>

<p>
He knew the Heer van Schrekhorn to be a rascal
capable of committing any outrage, and also that he
had personally a special grudge at Lewie Baronald.
Dolores was beautiful.  What if this scheme so
speciously arranged, was one for his own behoof, to
carry her off, leaving the onus of the abduction on the
shoulders of him&mdash;Morganstjern&mdash;after passing a
sword through his body among the willows near the
old mill on the Maese.
</p>

<p>
But this grave suspicion was only a passing thought,
and he thrust it aside.
</p>

<p>
'This may preclude your return for some time, and
compromise you with the authorities,' said the Heer.
</p>

<p>
'Their reign will soon be over; and when a French
army comes to the assistance of the Dutch patriots,
the Prince of Orange may find himself a fugitive in
England.'
</p>

<p>
'But we must be wary; not for all the gold and
silver bars in the Bank of Amsterdam would I be in
your shoes if we fail.  The Burgomasters are worse
than the devil to face, and we may find ourselves
behind the grilles of the Gevangepoort or the
Rasp-haus, as brawlers.'
</p>

<p>
'A thousand duyvels!&mdash;fail? don't think of it.'
</p>

<p>
Had Maurice Morganstjern known the intentions
of General Kinloch towards his nephew, and the
plans he had formed to separate him from Dolores,
he might have patiently awaited the events of the
next few days; but as he was ignorant of them, he
and the malevolent Heer van Schrekhorn laid all
their plans for the abduction of the girl with caution,
confidence, and extreme deliberation, before they
quitted the Golden Sun that night.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
THE GENERAL'S SECRET.
</h3>

<p>
Next day, when Lewie Baronald, apparelled in all
his regimental bravery, was setting forth to visit
Dolores, he was summoned by General Kinloch, who,
after working himself up to a certain degree of
sternness or firmness, real or assumed, for the occasion,
said:
</p>

<p>
'Stay, young man, I pray you, as we must have
some conversation together.'
</p>

<p>
Lewie took off his Khevenhüller hat, and fearing
that some animadversions were coming, played a little
irresolutely with its upright scarlet feather.
</p>

<p>
'Your name has gone in for foreign service, Lewie,'
said the General.
</p>

<p>
'To whom, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'The Director-General of Infantry.'
</p>

<p>
'Sent by you, uncle?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir, by me.'
</p>

<p>
'You might at least have consulted with me in this
matter.  How cruel of you, uncle, under all the
circumstances!' exclaimed Lewie, with sudden bitterness
and intense anger.
</p>

<p>
'You will come to think it kindness in time, boy;
I seek but to save you from what I, in my time,
underwent.'
</p>

<p>
'If I refuse to go?'
</p>

<p>
'Refuse, and compromise your honour and mine&mdash;yea,
the honour of the Brigade itself!  My dear
Lewie, when you have lived in this world as long
as I&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Why, uncle, you are only forty!'
</p>

<p>
'Not yet twice your age, certainly&mdash;well?'
</p>

<p>
'If detailed for the Colonies, anywhere, separation
from Dolores will be the death of me!' exclaimed the
young man passionately.
</p>

<p>
'No, it won't; nor of Dolores either.  So you are
very much in love with her?' asked the General with
a scornful grin.
</p>

<p>
'God only knows how purely I love her!' exclaimed
the nephew in a low concentrated voice.
</p>

<p>
'Nature is full of freaks, certainly!'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'She has varied the annals of the old fighting line
of the Baronalds of that Ilk, by having them varied
by something else.'
</p>

<p>
'By what?'
</p>

<p>
'A moonstruck fool!'
</p>

<p>
'This is eccentricity combined with unwarrantable
interference and military tyranny,' cried Lewie, as he
stuck his hat on his head and drew himself haughtily
up; then in a moment his mood changed, for he loved
this kinsman to whom he owed so much, and he said
with an air of dejection, 'How shall I ever tell Dolores
of what you have done to us both?  I cannot sail for
the Cape or the Caribbean Isles, and leave her bound
to me!  I must release her from her promise, though
I know that she would wait a lifetime for me.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor fool that you are, Lewie!  Do you forget the
adage, "Out of sight, out of mind"?  You think that,
like Penelope, she will wait your return in hope, in
love, and all the rest of it?  You may be like
Ulysses, but never was there a Penelope among
women.'
</p>

<p>
The General indulged in many more doubting and
slighting remarks upon women, particularly on their
faith and constancy; and while he was running on
thus, grief struggled with rage and indignation for
mastery in the heart of Lewie, which seemed to stand
still at this sudden wrench, and the prospect of an
abrupt and protracted separation from Dolores&mdash;a
separation that might be for years&mdash;every moment of
which would be an agonised heart-throb, it seemed to
him then!
</p>

<p>
How hard, how cruel, that they should be thus
separated, and forced to drink, as it were, of the bitter
waters of Marah, because this stern soldier hated all
women so grotesquely, as the Countess had said,
viewing them all through the medium of one; while
Lewie and Dolores were so young that all the world
seemed too small to contain the measure of their joy,
and now&mdash;now, thought was maddening!
</p>

<p>
He would resign, 'throw up his pair of colours,' as
the phrase was then; but his uncle had compromised
him, by sending in his name to the Director-General
of Infantry!
</p>

<p>
Already in anticipation he imagined and rehearsed
their parting; already he saw her tears, her blanched
face, and heard himself entreating her not to forget
him, while vowing himself to be true to her&mdash;each
regarding the other mournfully and yearningly, hand
clasped in hand, lip clinging to lip; then came the
void of the departure; the seas to plough, and the
years that were to come with all their doubts and
longing.
</p>

<p>
It was too bad&mdash;too bad; he owed his uncle much&mdash;all
in the world indeed; but this stroke&mdash;this harsh
interference, ended all between them for ever!
</p>

<p>
Overwhelmed with dejection he cast himself into a
chair; there the General regarded him wistfully, and
placing a hand kindly on his shoulder, said:
</p>

<p>
'Lewie, shall I tell you of what once happened to
me?'
</p>

<p>
But, full of his own terrible thoughts, Lewie made
no reply.
</p>

<p>
'It may have been that evil followed me,' said the
General, looking down, with a hand placed in the
breast of his coat.
</p>

<p>
'Evil?' repeated Lewie.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  When a boy I shot in the wood of
Thomineau the last crane that was ever seen in Scotland,
and my old nurse predicted that a curse would follow
me therefor; thus, I never see a crane on a house-top
here that I don't remember her words.  Now
listen to what happened to me when I was on
detachment in the Dutch West India Islands.  I
belonged then to the battalion of Charles Halkett
Craigie, who six years ago died Lieutenant-Governor
of Namur, and we garrisoned Fort Nassau, or New
Amsterdam as it is called now.  There,' continued
the General, alternately and nervously toying with
his sword-knot and shirt-frill, 'I was silly enough to
fall in love with the daughter of a wealthy merchant,
a Dutch girl, like your Dolores, with some of the old
Castilian blood in her, though a lineal descendant
of the great Dutch family of Van Peere, to whom, in
1678, Berbice was granted by the States-General as a
perpetual and hereditary fief.  She possessed great
beauty, and what proved more attractive still, a
hundred sweet and winning ways, with the art of
saying pretty and even daring little things, that
endeared her to all&mdash;to none more than me.  I was
a great ass, of course; but, heavens, what a coquette
she was!'
</p>

<p>
'What was her name?' asked Lewie, with just the
smallest amount of interest.
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me telling, as I have sworn never to utter
it again; nor do I wish it to go down in the annals of
our family.  She wound herself round my heart; my
soul, my existence, seemed to be hers.  My love for
her became a species of idolatry; but poverty tied my
tongue, and I dared not speak of it, till one evening,
which I shall never forget, the secret left me abruptly,
drawn from me by <i>herself</i>.  We were lingering in the
garden of her father's villa near the Berbice river, and
the stars were coming out, one by one, in the deep
blue sky above us.  The hour was beautiful&mdash;all
that a lover could wish; and around us the atmosphere
was fragrant with the perfume of flowers&mdash;among
those wonders of the vegetable world&mdash;the
gigantic water-lilies, each leaf of which is six feet in
diameter.  I was soon to leave for Holland on duty,
and my heart was wrung at the prospect of a separation.
</p>

<p>
'I had her hand in mine: my secret was trembling
on my lips; and gazing into her eyes which were of a
golden-brown colour, like that of her hair, I said very
softly:
</p>

<p>
'"If your eyes have at all times an expression so
sweet, so beautiful and winning, what must they seem
to the man who reads love in them&mdash;love for himself!"
</p>

<p>
'"Can you not read it now?" she asked in a low
voice, as she cast her long lashes down.
</p>

<p>
'I uttered her name and drew her close to me, my
heart beating wildly the while, in doubt whether
this was one of the daring little speeches I spoke
of.
</p>

<p>
'Taking her sweet little face between my hands, I
kissed her eyes and forehead, on which she said, in
her low cooing voice:
</p>

<p>
'"I wonder if you will ever think of me after you
are gone?"
</p>

<p>
'"Darling, do you think there will ever be a day of
my life when I will not think you!  Oh, the thought
of our parting is worse than death to me!"
</p>

<p>
('A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind,' thought
Lewie, becoming fully interested now.)
</p>

<p>
'"We are jesting," said she; "do not say this."
</p>

<p>
'"There is no need to tell you that I love you,"
said I, "for you know that I do&mdash;dearly, fondly:
that this love will last with life, end with death;" and
much more rubbish I said to the same purpose, adding,
"And you, if quite free, could you love me?"
</p>

<p>
'"I love you now; have I not admitted as much?"
</p>

<p>
'So it all came about in that way,' said the General;
'umph&mdash;what an ass I was!  May you never live to
be deceived as that girl deceived me!  I thought our
passion was mutual; and then perhaps she thought so
too&mdash;all perfidious though she was!
</p>

<p>
'But how happy&mdash;how radiantly happy I was for a
time, till a Dutch squadron came to anchor off the
bar of the Berbice river, and in one of the lieutenants
thereof she discovered, or said she discovered, a
kinsman; and from that moment a blight fell upon me,
and I discovered that she was variable as the wind.
Her attentions seemed divided for a time; at last
they were no longer given to me.  Her smiles were
for the stranger; she sang to him, played to him, and
talked to him only.  At home or abroad, riding or
driving, or boating on the river, he was ever by her
side when not on board his ship.
</p>

<p>
'What rage and mortification were in my heart!
The rules of the service alone prevented me calling
him to a terrible account, though indeed he was not
to blame.
</p>

<p>
'When I attempted to reason or remonstrate with
her, she laughed; then after a time became indignant.
We parted in anger, and I felt fury and death in my
heart when she tossed my engagement-ring at my feet.
</p>

<p>
'Once again we met, alone, and by the merest
chance.  How my pulses throbbed as our eyes met,
and she coyly presented her hand, which I was craven
enough, and fool enough, to fondle!
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, what have I done," said I, "that you should
treat me thus? that you should tread my heart under
your feet, and leave me to long years of sorrow and
repining?"
</p>

<p>
'Then she laughed, and snatched her hand away,
while once again my soul seemed to die within me.
</p>

<p>
'"Do you love this kinsman?" I asked her fiercely;
and never till my last hour shall I forget her reply, or
the almost cruel expression of her face.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes; I love him&mdash;love him with my whole heart,
and as I never loved you!"
</p>

<p>
'Turning away, she left me&mdash;left me rooted to the
spot.  Yet she had some shame, or compunction, left
in her after all; for next day came a would-be piteous
letter of explanation, that she had given this
lieutenant a promise to please her father when he was
dying&mdash;her father who was his guardian; how she
had never had the courage to tell me so at first; that
she did not dream I loved her so much; that I must
learn to forget her, though she would never forget me;
and so&mdash;a thousand devils!&mdash;there was an end of it.
</p>

<p>
'A few weeks after I saw her marriage in the
papers, to the Lieutenant&mdash;d&mdash;n his name&mdash;to her
and her fortune of ever so many thousand guilders.
</p>

<p>
'I tore her farewell letter into minute fragments,
and set to work to adopt her advice.'
</p>

<p>
'What was that?' asked Lewie.
</p>

<p>
'To forget her; and to do so I threw myself into my
profession.  I never looked upon her face again, and I
thanked God when I heard our drums beating as we
marched out of Fort Nassau, and when the accursed
shore of the Berbice river faded into the evening sea!
Now, Lewie, have I not the best of reasons for
mistrusting women, and seeking to save you from the
fangs of this little ogress&mdash;this Dolores?'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, you know not her of whom you speak thus!'
exclaimed Lewie.
</p>

<p>
'Nor am I likely to do so.  Shun her, nephew! a
girl, doubtless, with a fair face, and a heart as black
as Gehenna!  Be firm, Lewie Baronald!&mdash;firmness is a
great thing, as you will find when you come to be a
general officer and as old as I am.'
</p>

<p>
Lewie had done his duty like a man and a soldier&mdash;like
one worthy of the glorious old Brigade&mdash;among
the savages in the old Cape War; but it was cruel,
absurd, and, to use the Countess van Renslaer's phrase,
'grotesque,' that he should now be treated like a child,
and in the most momentous matter of his life and
happiness too!
</p>

<p>
'I was weak enough&mdash;idiot enough, to wish I might
die, then and there, when that girl deceived me,'
resumed his uncle bitterly; 'but I knew that I must
live on and on; I was very young, and thought I
might live for forty years with that pain in my heart
at night and in the morning.  It is twenty years since
then, and though the pain is dead, I suppose, I
cannot laugh at it yet, or the memory of Mercedes.'
</p>

<p>
'Mercedes! was that her name&mdash;Mercedes?'
</p>

<p>
'The devil&mdash;it has escaped me!'
</p>

<p>
'So that is the name which is not to go down in
the annals of the family?'
</p>

<p>
'Precisely so.'
</p>

<p>
'But surely, dear uncle, after all these years, you
must have forgiven her?  Besides, she may be dead.'
</p>

<p>
'Dead to me, certainly!  Forgiven her&mdash;well, perhaps
I may have forgiven her; but what can make a mere
mortal forget a wrong, a cruelty, or an injury?'
</p>

<p>
'Then you will not yield, but insist that I shall go
abroad?'
</p>

<p>
'I will not yield an inch, and march you shall!'
replied the General, as he turned on his heel and left
him.
</p>

<p>
'My darling Dolores&mdash;the first and only love of
my life!' exclaimed the young man passionately;
'how can he&mdash;how <i>dare</i> he&mdash;act thus towards us?
But that I love him, I think, I may soon come to hate
him!'
</p>

<p>
He rushed away in search of Dolores; but she and
the Countess were from home.  He was on duty at
the Palace next day, and Dolores was to be at the
ridotto; thus, ere they could meet, events were to
transpire which were altogether beyond the
conception of both.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
THE RIDOTTO.
</h3>

<p>
The 'ridotto,' the Italian word then fashionable for
an entertainment of music and dancing, at the huge
old red-brick villa of the Heer van Otterbeck, Minister
of State, in the vicinity of the Hague, was one of the
gayest affairs of the season.
</p>

<p>
The Prince of Orange (whose son afterwards became
King of the Netherlands) was not present, but all the
rank, the wealth, and beauty of the Hague were
represented; and among those present were many
officers of the Scots Brigade, including the Earl of
Drumlanrig, General Dundas, in after years the
captor of the Cape of Good Hope; and there too was
the Conservator of Scottish Privileges at Campvere,
John Home, then the celebrated author of the nearly
forgotten tragedy of 'Douglas.'
</p>

<p>
A band of the Dutch Guards furnished music on the
lawn, and there dancing was in progress in the bright
sunshine of the summer afternoon; and, in the fashion
of the time, many of the guests were arrayed in what
they deemed the costume of Arcadian shepherds and
shepherdesses.
</p>

<p>
People danced early in the evenings of the eighteenth
century, and were abed about the time their descendants
now begin to dress for a ball.  Ices were unknown;
no wine was dispensed, but the liveried
servants of the Heervan Otterbeck regaled his guests
on coffee, green tea, orange tea, and many kinds of
cakes and confectionery in the intervals of the
dancing, in which Dolores (all innocent and
unaware of the plots in progress against her peace,
even her honour and liberty&mdash;one of them born of
avarice, wounded vanity, and foiled desire) indulged
joyously and with all her heart.
</p>

<p>
For the information of the ladies of the present day
we shall detail the dress worn by Dolores on that
evening as described in the <i>Hague Gazette</i>, and they
may imagine how charming she looked:
</p>

<p>
'Her body and train were silver tissue, with a broad
silver fringe; her petticoat was white satin covered
with the richest crape, embroidered with silver,
fastened up with bunches of silver roses, tassels, and
cords.  Her pocket-holes were blonde, her stockings
were blue, clocked with silver, and her hair was twisted
and plaited in the most beautiful manner around a
diamond comb.'
</p>

<p>
Seated under a tree, flushed with a recent dance, she
was alternately playing with her fan and silver
pomander ball, with a crowd of admirers about her,
and looking alike pure and bright, with 'a skin as
though she had been dieted on milk and roses.'
</p>

<p>
'No wonder it is, perhaps, that Lewie loves me,'
thought the girl, as she looked at the reflection of her
own sweet face in a little bit of oval mirror in the
back of her huge Dutch fan; 'I <i>am</i> pretty!'
</p>

<p>
She might have said 'lovely,' and more than lovely;
and then she smiled consciously at her own vanity.
</p>

<p>
Under the genial influence of her surroundings the
heart of the girl was full of happiness, and had but
one regret that Lewie Baronald was not there.  Yet,
she thought, 'to-morrow I shall see him&mdash;to-morrow
be with my darling, who at this moment is thinking
of me.'
</p>

<p>
And amid the brilliance of the scene, so rich in the
variety of colour and costume, the strains of the
music and beauty of the old Dutch pleasure-grounds,
she almost longed to be alone, with the grass, the
birds, the insects, and the flowers&mdash;alone in the sweet
summer evening with the perfume of the roses, the
jasmine, and the glorious honeysuckle around her.
</p>

<p>
On one hand, about a mile distant, was the Hague,
with all its Gothic spires and pointed gables; on the
other spread the landscape so usual in that country
of cheese and butter&mdash;church-towers and wind-mills,
bright farmhouses, long rows of willow-trees, their
green foliage ruffling up white in the passing breeze;
the grassy dykes and embankments, a long continuity
of horizontal lines, which seemed so tame and insipid
to the mountaineers of the Scots Brigade, and to all
but the Dutch themselves.
</p>

<p>
Among the groups around her, Dolores, as usual
now, heard the growing political quarrel between
Great Britain and Holland openly and freely
discussed, together with the consequent and too probable
departure of the Scots Brigade from the latter for
ever.  That seemed almost a settled thing&mdash;a
certainty, if the quarrel became an open one, and the
probabilities wrung the girl's affectionate heart.
</p>

<p>
How would all this affect her lover and herself?
Alas! she knew not that the doom of the former for
foreign service was nearly a fixed thing now!  And
she was fated to receive her first mental shock that
evening, all unwittingly, from the Earl of Drumlanrig,
who drew near her, and with the stately manner of
the time lifted his hat with one hand, and with the
other touched her hand as he bowed over it.
</p>

<p>
The golden light of the setting sun fell full upon
her hair, flecking its bronze with glorious tints, and
giving her beauty a brilliance that, to the Earl's
appreciative eye, was very striking.
</p>

<p>
'You look like one of Watteau's beauties, waiting
to hear herself addressed in the language of Love,'
said the old peer, smiling.
</p>

<p>
'Love has three languages, my lord,' observed
Dolores.
</p>

<p>
'Three?'
</p>

<p>
'The pen, the tongue, and the eyes.'
</p>

<p>
'True; but I am too old to use any of these now,'
said the Earl, shaking his powdered head.
</p>

<p>
'The evening is a lovely one,' observed Dolores,
after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'And the landscape yonder, as it stretches away
towards Delft, is wonderfully steeped in sunshine; and
but for its flatness&mdash;&mdash;' the Earl paused.
</p>

<p>
'Your Scottish eyes cannot forgive that,' said
Dolores laughing, as she recalled some of Lewie
Baronald's complaints on the same subject; 'but
people cannot live on scenery.'
</p>

<p>
'So the great Samuel Johnson has written.'
</p>

<p>
'Who is he?' asked Dolores.
</p>

<p>
'A great lexicographer&mdash;a wonderful English
savant&mdash;who believes in a ghost in London, yet
discredited the late earthquake at Lisbon.  I think I
have seen you at the Vyverberg with Lewis Baronald
of my battalion; he has the honour of being known
to you.'
</p>

<p>
'He visits us,' replied Dolores, the flower-like
tints of her sweet face growing brighter as the Earl
spoke.
</p>

<p>
'He is a fine and handsome fellow, young Baronald;
but it is strange that he should wish to quit the
Hague when it possesses such peculiar attractions,'
said the Earl markedly, and with a courteous bow.
</p>

<p>
'Quit the Hague!' repeated Dolores, as if she had
not heard him aright.
</p>

<p>
'I do not know whether the desire to do so, has any
connection with his uncle's scheme for the recapture
or restitution to Holland of the Island of Goree, off
the coast of Senegal, in defiance of the old Treaty of
Nimeguen, which gave it to France, a scheme which
will win him the favour of their Mightinesses; but
young Baronald's name was sent, through me this
morning, to the Director-General of Infantry, for
instant foreign service.'
</p>

<p>
'Foreign service!' whispered Dolores, in an almost
breathless voice, while her white throat gave a sharp
nervous gasp, and her long lashes drooped over her
beautiful eyes.  'Surely, my lord, this must be some
mistake.  Lewie&mdash;he had no desire to leave Holland,
in any way&mdash;he dreaded nothing so much as the
departure of the Brigade to Britain; and
this&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'No mistake, I assure you,' interrupted the Earl, all
unaware of the astonishment he was exciting and the
pain he was inflicting, and both of which he must
have perceived had not the Heer van Otterbeck,
fortunately for Dolores, approached at that moment,
and tapping and proffering his Sèvres china snuff-box,
'buttonholed' him on the inevitable subjects, the
quarrel between Britain and Holland, Paul Jones in
the Texel, and Commodore Fielding's conduct in
firing on the Dutch fleet in the Channel, which the
Commodore did with hearty goodwill.
</p>

<p>
But for Dolores, the charms of the ridotto had
vanished now; and in sore perturbation of spirit and
anxiety of heart, she bade her host and hostess a
hurried farewell, summoned her sedan, and took her
departure homeward.
</p>

<p>
The lights, the music&mdash;the music of Lulli; the
<i>minuet de la cour</i>, and the gaiety of the ridotto, faded
away behind her as the heiress took the somewhat
lonely road that led to the villa of her mother.
</p>

<p>
She was escorted to her sedan by an officer of the
Brigade, a friend of Lewie's, who, as he closed the roof
of it over her, thought that she looked like&mdash;as he
vowed to some others&mdash;'a lovely queen in wax-work
done up in a glass-case.'

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
THE ABDUCTORS.
</h3>

<p>
What was this mystery concerning the movements
and intentions of Lewie Baronald, on which the Earl
of Drumlanrig had so abruptly but unconsciously
thrown a light?
</p>

<p>
When last they met and parted, Lewie had given
no hint of any desire for foreign service, and certainly,
with the relations then existing between himself and
her, it was the last thing to be thought of.
</p>

<p>
'Oh,' thought Dolores, 'that I were at home to
consult mamma on this amazing subject!'
</p>

<p>
Her bearers seemed to crawl; she narrowly opened
and shut her fan again and again in her impatience,
and stamped her little foot on the floor of the sedan
in her irritation and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Yes! that horrid General&mdash;that odious uncle, the
eccentric woman-hater, was no doubt at the bottom
of it, and had thus resolved to separate Lewie from
her, and hot tears started to her eyes at the thought.
</p>

<p>
Though in the immediate vicinity of the Hague,
the road was as lonely as those who awaited her
thereon could have wished.  The blue dome of
heaven, a dome studded with diamonds&mdash;each itself
a world&mdash;was overhead; and steady and silvery was
the light of the uprisen moon, above the far expanse
of the level landscape.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Dolores heard the sound of voices; there
were threats on one hand and expostulation on the
other.  The sedan, with a violent jolt, was suddenly
deposited on the ground, and its bearers were dashed
aside, as she supposed, by foot-pads.  Then a shriek
of dismay escaped Dolores, when a man, whose face
was half-concealed by a crape mask, threw up the
roof of the sedan, opened the door and attempted to
drag her out by the hand.
</p>

<p>
She saw another similarly masked, and a caleche,
with a pair of horses, close by.
</p>

<p>
Never dreaming of outrage for a moment, she
thought that she must be the victim of some
extraordinary mistake, till she recognised the voice of
Maurice Morganstjern, when her alarm and astonishment
instantly changed to indignation.
</p>

<p>
'Maurice,' she exclaimed, 'for whom do you mistake
me?  What outrage is this?'
</p>

<p>
'No mistake at all, my pretty cousin; will you
please to take your seat in this caleche?' he replied
deliberately.
</p>

<p>
'For what purpose?'
</p>

<p>
'Time will show, beloved Dolores.'
</p>

<p>
'Loose my hand.  I wish none of your fair words;
they are ever hateful and unwelcome to my ear:
more so than ever when you come thus&mdash;as you must
be&mdash;intoxicated,' she added, believing this to be the
case.
</p>

<p>
'Beware, cousin&mdash;beware!  You know how I love
you, and yet you spurn me.  Come, Schrekhorn, and
help me to lift her into the caleche.  For all the past
bitterness I shall have a sweet revenge; and, Dolores,
you will learn to love me, when you will have none
else in this world to cling to.'
</p>

<p>
On seeing the Heer van Schrekhorn, of whose
character she had heard something, approach her,
the girl looked wildly round in terror: the road was
lonely; her home was at some distance, yet the lights
in its windows were visible; but no help was nigh.
She now perceived that nothing less than her forcible
abduction was daringly intended; but what lay in
the future beyond that, she could scarcely realise.
</p>

<p>
Her first fears returned with double force, for she
knew the recklessness of the two men at whose mercy
she found herself.  How lovely and helpless she
looked!
</p>

<p>
Ruffian and coward though he was, Maurice Morganstjern
was a consummate egotist, and her continued
indifference and contempt of him had deeply wounded
his <i>amour propre</i>, and roused a spirit of revenge.
</p>

<p>
'It is useless to fight against Fate, Cousin Dolores;
and Fate decrees that you are to be mine!' said he,
firmly grasping her hand.
</p>

<p>
'Oh that I were a man!' exclaimed Dolores.
</p>

<p>
'For what purpose?'
</p>

<p>
'To strike you to the earth for your insolence and
daring.'
</p>

<p>
'In that case I would not seek to carry you off; so,
I thank Heaven that you are not a man, sweet
cousin!'  He placed his face close to hers, and lowering
his voice, said through his clenched teeth: 'Listen
to me, Dolores; you have, I fear, plighted yourself to
the Scotsman Baronald in ignorance of yourself, and
now I am here to rescue you from the death in life
to which your girlish folly would doom you.  I will
soon teach you to forget that artful interloper, if you
ever thought seriously about him, which I cannot
believe, and our marriage will alter all your ideas.'
</p>

<p>
These references to her lover infuriated Dolores,
who was a high-spirited girl; but he wound his arms
round her despite all her efforts.  With all her
strength she kept him, however, at arms' length,
exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
'I hate you&mdash;oh, how I hate you!'
</p>

<p>
'Cease this nonsense, cousin; a day is coming when
you will love me as much as you may think you hate
me now!'
</p>

<p>
'And what will cause the change?' she asked scornfully.
</p>

<p>
'Marriage.'
</p>

<p>
'Why waste time thus?' asked the Heer van
Schrekhorn, who had not yet spoken, and who listened
to all this with manifest impatience and uneasiness;
'we know not who may come upon us; so into the
caleche with her at once!' he added with an oath.
</p>

<p>
''Sdeath, but she is as strong as I am!' exclaimed
Morganstjern, as he strove to drag her from the
sedan.
</p>

<p>
Her slender figure stood very erect, and with tiny
hands she strove to free herself from his odious grasp;
but the scorn, indignation, and passionate resentment
that flashed in her dark eyes and curled her tender
lips, now gave place to much of genuine fear of her
assailants and how far their daring might carry them,
especially when the Heer laid his brutal hands upon
her; and uttering a wild cry she clung to the sedan,
and without a resort to extreme violence would not
be torn from it.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the driver of the caleche, who was in
ignorance of the purpose his employers had in view,
looked on somewhat scared, and was thinking of how
he might, in the future, be handled by the Burgomaster
or other authorities.
</p>

<p>
Dolores suddenly found her strength give way, and
felt about to faint, when she heard a loud and
wrathful exclamation as Morganstjern was dashed aside on
one hand, Schrekhorn knocked down in a heap on the
other, and there towered between her and them a tall
military-looking man, wearing a Khevenhüller hat,
and having a scarlet roquelaure wrapped round him.
</p>

<p>
The latter he instantly threw off, and drew his
sword, on which the driver of the caleche whipped up
his horses, and fled at full speed towards the Hague,
leaving his employers to get out of the affair as they
best could.
</p>

<p>
The first impulse of the two conspirators was to
unsheath their swords also; but their second was to
pause ere attempting to use them, as they recognised
in their assailant an officer of the Scots Brigade, and
one of high rank apparently by his gold aiguilette.
</p>

<p>
'Protect me, sir&mdash;save me!' implored Dolores.
</p>

<p>
'Scoundrels!' exclaimed the new-comer, waving in
a circle round her his long straight sword, the blade
of which glittered in the moonlight, and at sight of
which Morganstjern fairly shrunk back; 'scoundrels,
come on if you dare!'
</p>

<p>
'Accursed fool that I have been to delay as I did!'
said Morganstjern.
</p>

<p>
'An accursed fool indeed!' rejoined the Heer
furiously.
</p>

<p>
'Defend yourselves!' exclaimed the officer, attacking
them both at once, and in a moment Morganstjern
found his sword twisted out of his hand and flung
high in the air by a circular parry, while the Heer was
rendered defenceless by a thrust between the bones
of his sword-arm, on which they both turned and fled,
muttering curses loud and deep.
</p>

<p>
'Heaven sent you to my aid, sir, just in time,'
said Dolores, bursting into tears now; 'another
moment, and I should have fainted helplessly in their
clutches.'
</p>

<p>
'These seemed no common brawlers&mdash;can you
name them?' asked General Kinloch, for he it was,
as he sheathed his sword, and lifted his Khevenhüller
respectfully.
</p>

<p>
'I can name them; but would, as yet, rather be
excused, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Henckers!  I should like to see both tied to the
<i>Gesteel Paul</i>' (<i>i.e.</i>, the whipping-post).
</p>

<p>
The General now found himself face to face, in the
bright moonlight, with a young lady of more than
ordinary beauty; but, when the expression of her eyes,
her thick brown hair, defined eyelashes, and lovely
lips reminded him, as he thought, of a face he had
known long ago, and loved to look upon; and her
voice, too, was so like the voice of that other, coming
as it were out of the mists of memory, he grew cold
and rigid in manner, as he said:
</p>

<p>
'I have no desire to penetrate your secret, young
lady, if secret there is that leads you to conceal the
names of these men.'
</p>

<p>
'I have no secrets, sir; but one of these assailants
is my near kinsman&mdash;a cousin,' replied Dolores, a
little haughtily.
</p>

<p>
'Then allow me to have the honour of escorting
you home.'
</p>

<p>
'I thank you, sir; the gate is close by.'
</p>

<p>
Again the courteous officer lifted his hat, and held
it in one hand, while he led Dolores to the iron gate,
which led to the garden-path terminating at the door
of the Countess's villa; and then bidding her
farewell, he turned away, his good opinion of her by no
means increased by her peculiar reticence as to the
names of those from whose outrageous conduct he
had saved her.
</p>

<p>
'Odd&mdash;very!' he muttered; 'but every woman is
an enigma!'
</p>

<p>
As he was about to close the iron gate, something
glittering on the gravelled path caught his eye, and it
proved to be a bracelet of considerable value, which
had become injured in the struggle between Dolores
and her assailants, and thus no doubt dropped from
her wrist.
</p>

<p>
'One of her vain gauds, of course,' muttered the
General; 'yet why should she not wear such, as all
other female tricksters do?&mdash;a pretty creature&mdash;a
charming girl, in fact!  But what the devil am I
saying? with all her prettiness she is no doubt false
as she is fair&mdash;Dead Sea fruit, in fact.  I shall send
her bauble by my servant to-morrow, and&mdash;but
no&mdash;egad!  I'll deliver it in person.'
</p>

<p>
Returning to the door of the villa, the General used
the great knocker, with which&mdash;all unknown to
him&mdash;the hand of his nephew Lewie Baronald was so
familiar.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0110"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
THE FAIR WIDOW.
</h3>

<p>
While waiting on the door-step he looked a little
contemptuously at the female ornament, though it
was suggestive of a slender and a pretty wrist; but
suddenly the expression of his face changed.  He
had either seen that gold bracelet before, or one most
strangely like it, with a similar circle of diamonds
round a large emerald; it gave him some curious,
angry and bitter thoughts.
</p>

<p>
'Mynheer, did you knock?' asked a servant, rousing
him from his reverie; and the General then became
aware that the door was open, and a flood of warm
light was streaming from a chandelier through a
stately entrance-hall beyond.
</p>

<p>
He made known his errand, asked for the young
lady, and was ushered into the drawing-room, which
at that moment was untenanted.
</p>

<p>
Then, as now, the Dutch drawing-room was deemed
a kind of sanctum or state-room, entered but seldom,
the chief glory of which is always its highly-polished
floor; so much so, that in some parts of Holland the
visitor is still obliged to take off his shoes, or be very
careful how he cleans them before admittance is
granted.
</p>

<p>
In the aspect of the mansion there was much that
indicated a substantial account at the Bank of
Amsterdam; but that was as nothing to General
Kinloch: he never thought of it.
</p>

<p>
By the light of a large lamp, the General had only
time to remark that on the walls hung some clever and
brilliant flower-pieces by De Heem, Huysum, and
others, when Dolores stood before him, still clad in
the brilliant costume she had worn at the ridotto, and
looking radiantly beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Though surprised by the visit, she was glad to see
her preserver so soon again.  Her heart was full of
intense gratitude for the succour he had afforded her,
and she felt conscious that in her confusion and
perturbation of spirit she had not shown enough, or
half enough, of gratitude to him; yet he had saved
her from a fate that would have been worse than
death.
</p>

<p>
With a low bow he tendered her the bracelet, with
a few well-chosen words of explanation.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, dear sir, a thousand times!' she
exclaimed; 'it was mamma's, and its loss would have
grieved me much.  To whom am I indebted for all
this kindness?'
</p>

<p>
'My name is Kinloch&mdash;General Kinloch, at your
service, Colonel-Commandant of the Scots Brigade,'
he replied with another profound old-fashioned bow.
</p>

<p>
Lewie's uncle&mdash;the terrible General&mdash;the ogre, as
she had been wont to call and deem him!  The breath
of poor Dolores was quite taken away with surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Mamma is a widow,' said she after a pause; 'you
must see her and receive her thanks.  A widow and
very beautiful,' she added in thought, with the hope
that the Countess might win the favour of this grim
soldier for Lewie and herself.
</p>

<p>
'A widow,' repeated the General, with an unmistakable
grimace, and with ill-suppressed cynicism in
his voice; 'oh, indeed!' and he thought with a writer
who says, 'A widow smacks of the charnel-house;
she either did love her husband, or she didn't;
and in either case who would care to be his successor?'
</p>

<p>
The Countess at that moment entered the room
and came forward with one of her brightest smiles;
but suddenly she paused, and the smile faded out of
her beautiful face.  Kinloch returned her bow with a
startled air, and to the acute eyes of Dolores it seemed
that a recognition, that was no common one, took place
between her mother and the General.
</p>

<p>
For a time&mdash;but a very little time&mdash;amid her terror
and dismay at the attack made upon herself, Dolores
had forgotten the Earl of Drumlanrig's startling
intelligence about Lewie's departure for foreign service;
but now the memory of it returned in full force, and
she looked coldly and earnestly yet distrustfully upon
the General as their mutual enemy.
</p>

<p>
'Mamma,' said she, 'this is the gentleman of whom
I told you, and who saved me from my assailants.'
</p>

<p>
'My daughter is under the greatest of obligations to
you&mdash;how can I thank you, General Kinloch?' added
the Countess, presenting her hand, which he touched
slightly, but with reluctance and hesitation.
</p>

<p>
'Mercedes,' said he; 'you recognise me, then!'
</p>

<p>
Both were agitated and pale; but the Countess was
the first to recover herself.
</p>

<p>
'What&mdash;you know each other, and he even knows
your name!' exclaimed Dolores with blank astonishment.
</p>

<p>
Finding a necessity for speaking, the Countess
thanked him for the service so promptly and gallantly
rendered to her daughter, and expressed no small
indignation at the daring of Maurice Morganstjern
and his abettor; but while she spoke the General
listened to her as one in a dream, while the sorely
puzzled Dolores looked wonderingly on.
</p>

<p>
The original of the miniature now concealed in a
secret drawer of the Dutch cabinet before referred to,
treasured for years through all his alleged misogyny,
was again before him.
</p>

<p>
'It is long since we met,' said the Countess.
</p>

<p>
'And&mdash;parted,' replied the General, in a hard voice.
</p>

<p>
'You have attained high rank now.'
</p>

<p>
'I was but a lieutenant in Halkett-Craigie's
Battalion, <i>then</i>,' said he pointedly.
</p>

<p>
'Sir, I pray you to be seated,' and he mechanically
took the chair indicated by a motion of her pretty
white hand; 'you are not much changed since&mdash;since&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And you are scarcely changed at all.'
</p>

<p>
In the lovely matron, in ripe and full womanhood,
he had recognised her in a moment&mdash;the girl of the
hidden miniature, the early love of his youth, Mercedes
who had deceived him, who had well-nigh broken his
heart and embittered his whole existence.
</p>

<p>
The golden-brown hair his hands had once loved to
fondle and toy with, seemed now more golden than
ever, as it was sprinkled a little with brown <i>marchale</i>,
in the fashion of the day; but Dolores, in advance of
it, wore her rich hair without any such doubtful
accessory, and simply brushed backward over a low toupee
that showed the contour of her low, broad, and
beautiful forehead.
</p>

<p>
Twenty years had come and twenty years had
gone since he last looked on them, yet in the eyes of
Mercedes was the old subtle influence, in her voice
the old subtle power; and he felt both so keenly&mdash;so
intensely&mdash;that the thrill which passed through the
heart of Kinloch amounted to&mdash;if we may use a
paradox&mdash;a joyous pain!
</p>

<p>
Memories of the past time, by the Berbice
river&mdash;memories sweet and sad and thrilling&mdash;were coming
back with strange and curious force; the past
returned, the present fled, and much that both had
thought was long since dead, was reawakened within
them.
</p>

<p>
'Mamma!' exclaimed Dolores, with irrepressible
impatience and curiosity; 'you know General Kinloch!
you have met before!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Dolores darling&mdash;my heart certainly tells me
so,' replied the Countess, colouring deeply.
</p>

<p>
'Heart!' said the General; 'madame, the heart
is an obsolete organ, in this our eighteenth
century.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps it is too late in life to assume you can
have any interest in me now; but if you will not, even
once, take my hand kindly in yours, I shall think that
it is not wounded love, but wounded pride, that inspires
you still.'
</p>

<p>
The Countess spoke sweetly, and with one of her
brightest and most caressing smiles.
</p>

<p>
He pressed her little hand for a moment; it was
a mighty advance for the General to do so, but the
touch sent a thrill to his heart, and he thought how
absurdly young she looked to be the mother of
Dolores!
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens!' that young lady was thinking,
'wonders will never cease.'
</p>

<p>
So the courteous gentleman, the brave Scottish
soldier who had saved her&mdash;Lewie's terrible
uncle&mdash;was her mother's early lover!
</p>

<p>
'The past is gone,' said the General gravely and
sadly, and making an effort to withdraw, and yet
staying nevertheless; 'so let us not tear open an old
wound.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon, and permit me to heal it, if I can,' said the
Countess coquettishly, as she touched his bronzed
hand with her lovely lips, and at this touch he
trembled; so Dolores, saying something about taking
off her ornaments, withdrew and left them, wonder
and joy mingling in her heart together, while the
General made an effort to appear indifferent, and to
speak calmly, an effort in which he, eventually,
signally failed.
</p>

<p>
'It is strange, madame,' said he; 'but I have lived
so completely in camp and caserne, that I knew not
that Mercedes&mdash;the Mercedes of other days, and the
Countess van Renslaer, of whom my nephew speaks
so much, were one and the same.'
</p>

<p>
'My husband, the Lieutenant&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
The General coughed, and said interrupting:
</p>

<p>
'Whom you preferred to poor John Kinloch of the
Scots Brigade&mdash;well?'
</p>

<p>
'Died soon after succeeding to his title&mdash;a Flemish
one&mdash;and I have been a widow since.'
</p>

<p>
'All these years?'
</p>

<p>
'All these years.'
</p>

<p>
Her long dark eyelashes flickered as she looked
coyly at him, and then cast them down.
</p>

<p>
'I have never cared for another woman since <i>that</i>
time,' said the General after a pause; 'and I never
shall if I lived for&mdash;for&mdash;as long as the Brigade has
been in Holland&mdash;and that is two hundred years.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed, but noiselessly; for she knew that when
he began to talk thus, how his thoughts were wandering,
and that he might, after all, begin to think that
his future, for pleasure or pain, lay in the little white
hands of the charming widow before him&mdash;of herself&mdash;the
Mercedes of his early days by the Berbice
river.
</p>

<p>
'As for the Count&mdash;&mdash;' she began, but paused, for
the General made a gesture of impatience, and playing
with his sword-knot, said:
</p>

<p>
'Well, you married him, and not John Kinloch.
You are a free woman now; would you like to take
my heart in your toils again, Mercedes, to make sport
of it after all these years?'
</p>

<p>
'Do not speak to me thus,' said she in her most
seductive voice, as she touched his hand caressingly;
'I say too, after all these years, do not be so
implacable.  Ah! what must I think of you?'
</p>

<p>
'Think what you please.'
</p>

<p>
Again the long lashes flickered, and the snow-white
eyelids drooped.
</p>

<p>
The General felt his position was becoming imperilled,
that he 'was getting his flanks turned,' and
so forth; and he rose to retire.
</p>

<p>
But the General resumed his seat, and began to
look a little vacantly and helplessly about him.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
OMNIA VINCIT AMOR.
</h3>

<p>
'In the course of our lives it chances,' says a writer
truly, 'that most of us influence directly or indirectly,
in a greater or lesser degree, the lives of others; but,
as a general rule, we do not recognise this influence
until <i>after</i> the effect has taken place.'
</p>

<p>
The Commandant of the Scots Brigade was yet
to realise this.
</p>

<p>
There was a strange tremor in the usually stout
heart of the general now, for though, after the sudden
recognition of his first and, sooth to say, only love,
he had begun to school himself to meet her with
calmness or indifference, as a new friend, or old
acquaintance, he felt himself as wax in her hands;
and that it was impossible, even after the lapse of all
these years, to meet her unmoved, and to sit eye to
eye, and listening to her voice&mdash;the voice that had
thrilled his heart in the old time, and was thrilling it
now again.
</p>

<p>
He took her hand in his, and she permitted him to
retain it; but for the life of him he knew not what
to say, or how to take up the thread of the old story;
so she took the initiative.
</p>

<p>
'You were but a young lieutenant,' said she softly,
'when last we met.'
</p>

<p>
'And parted, as I said before.'
</p>

<p>
His reply conveyed a species of reproach, as he had
much to forgive; yet it seemed that there was an
almost unconscious appeal in this reference to the old
tie that bound them together once, and that now, did
not seem to have been so completely severed after all.
</p>

<p>
'To my dying day, Mercedes, I thought I should
remember your farewell glance at me,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Forget it now,' she replied softly.
</p>

<p>
'Can I do otherwise?' he asked, as he read the shy
light in downcast eyes.  'But oh, Mercedes,
if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'But I must not think it now&mdash;if your sweet lips
should be but tricking me again!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, think not so!'
</p>

<p>
Round hers his hand closed once again, and with
its clasp came the earnest of a promise that each
would never fail the other again; and then a great
brightness seemed suddenly to fall upon the hearts
and lives of both.
</p>

<p>
'Oh face so loved in the past time!' said Kinloch,
as he drew her towards him and kissed her fondly, to
the growing amazement of Dolores, who was about
to enter the room, but withdrew softly, her heart
tremulous with joy, though laughing, as a young girl
is sure to do, at what she deemed a pair of elderly
lovers; and yet the General was barely in his fortieth
year.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to her that his resentment against her
sex in general, and against widows in particular, had
evaporated very quickly!
</p>

<p>
The General had felt the cold coquetry of Mercedes
in the past&mdash;her desertion of him&mdash;too keenly, not to
be deeply stirred and to feel her influence now.
</p>

<p>
The old love that in his heart had never died, but
had been curiously woven up with a species of hate,
came to the surface once more, and the assurance of
it was flattering to the still beautiful Mercedes.
'Love,' it is said, 'cannot be measured by time; it
springs up like fungus in the night.  It flourishes
apace, and, like the wind, none know whence it cometh,
or whither it goeth.'
</p>

<p>
'Could you care still for such a fogey as I have
become?' asked the General in a low voice; 'care for
me again, I mean?'
</p>

<p>
'I am not now the thoughtless girl you loved in the
past time.'
</p>

<p>
'But you are the woman I love now&mdash;the girl I
never forgot and never ceased to love!' he exclaimed,
while surprised at his own impetuosity and fluency.
'Once, at least, in our lives heaven seems to open to
all of us: it opened to me when I first knew and
loved Mercedes; and now heaven seems to have
come to me again!'
</p>

<p>
And now, to the memory of both, there came back
the murmur of the Berbice river, with its giant
water-lilies; the glorious moon and stars of the tropics,
looking down on the grassy ramparts of Fort Nassau,
the palisades and spires of New Amsterdam, and the
love-scenes of the past time; and when Kinloch rose
to depart, it was with the promise that he would return
betimes on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
It would be rather difficult to describe the emotions
of the whilom misogynist, as he turned on his homeward way.
</p>

<p>
Joy at being restored to Mercedes, and gratified
vanity that he could yet inspire love, conflicted
curiously with a dread that he had compromised his
own dignity and his long-vaunted opinions of the sex
by this sudden surrender&mdash;this yielding to her great
beauty and her old influence over him.
</p>

<p>
What would Drumlanrig, Dundas, and other old
chums of the Brigade think of him? and what would
Lewie Baronald say?&mdash;poor Lewie, whom he had
doomed to foreign service to save him, as he had
phrased it, 'from the fangs of Dolores'!
</p>

<p>
He felt his brown cheek blush hotly at the thought.
</p>

<p>
'That must be amended,' he muttered; 'to-morrow
I shall see the Director-General of Infantry.'
</p>

<p>
It was impossible for him to shut his eyes to the
fact that Dolores was every way a desirable bride for
Lewie; and that, apart from her being the daughter
of his own first and only love, she was the <i>lionne</i> of
the Hague, who was fêted and courted, whose toilettes
were copied, whose sallies were retailed, and who was
the central figure in society there.
</p>

<p>
At last he stood in his old familiar room, where
hung more than one old tattered colour of the Brigade,
riven by Spanish bullets and Walloon pikes.  How
much had passed&mdash;how great was the change in his
thoughts, hopes, and intentions, since he had left it,
but a few hours ago!
</p>

<p>
He scarcely thought himself the same John Kinloch,
as he drew forth the miniature from its secret drawer
in the old cabinet, and sat down to contemplate it
with loving and tender thoughts, and literally to
'feast' his eyes, as the phrase is, on the face of her
who, before she went to sleep that night, pressed her
ripe coral lips to her own hand; and they sought the
exact place where the General, ere leaving, had pressed
<i>his</i>.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0112"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
We have not much more to relate.
</p>

<p>
Maurice Morganstjern quitted the Hague suddenly,
and betook him on his diplomatic mission, whatever
it was, to Paris; and his compatriot the Heer van
Schrekhorn thought it conducive to his personal
safety to make himself scarce about the same time;
so both were beyond the just vengeance of Lewie
Baronald.
</p>

<p>
Great was the amazement of the latter when he
found his uncle, the General, quite <i>en famille</i> at the
villa of the Countess, and learned from Dolores
something of what had transpired on the night of the
ridotto, and of her perilous adventure.
</p>

<p>
It seemed simply incredible!
</p>

<p>
'How now, uncle, about the name of Mercedes?' he
asked him laughingly.
</p>

<p>
'What about it?' asked the General testily, yet
reddening like a great schoolboy.
</p>

<p>
'Is it to go down in the annals of our family?'
</p>

<p>
'I hope so.'
</p>

<p>
"And how about all the Dead Sea fruit, the blackness
of Gehenna, your firmness, and all that?'
</p>

<p>
'Silence, you young dog!'
</p>

<p>
And merrily laughed Dolores as she ran her white
fingers over the piano, and sang a verse of the song
that had now become so familiar to her:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The love that I have chosen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is to my heart's content;<br>
  The salt sea will be frozen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that I repent.<br>
  Repent it will I never,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the day I dee,<br>
  Though the Lowlands o' Holland<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have parted my love and me.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'And your home is Scotland&mdash;the home to which
you may take me, is it like this?' asked the Countess
softly of the General, as they sat in the recess of a
window; and from the question it may be safely
gathered that events had progressed rapidly between
them.
</p>

<p>
'Like <i>this</i>!' exclaimed the General; 'you must see
it for yourself to know the difference,' he added, as his
eye swept the dull, dead flat of the Dutch landscape&mdash;flat
as the flattest part of England.
</p>

<p>
Then he laughed as he thought of Thominean
overshadowed by the majestic Ochills, the deep glens of
which, with their solemn shadows and silence, are
calculated to fill the soul at times with a species of
poetic or melancholy ecstasy; the grey precipices past
which the river rushes to Loch Leven, and the old
mansion on its rock&mdash;half chateau and half
fortress&mdash;of which Mercedes would some day be
chatelaine.
</p>

<p>
But soon after all this, a shock awaited the
General, when an orderly dragoon placed in his
hand a large official packet addressed to himself,
and sealed with the official seal of the Dutch
Republic.
</p>

<p>
It announced that which had long been expected,
that their High Mightinesses the States-General had
dispensed with the services of the Scots Brigade, and
a day was named when it would embark on board a
squadron of British ships for Scotland, and be placed,
as so many of its officers now desired, at the disposal
of his Britannic Majesty.
</p>

<p>
The General's heart gave a throb.  He had ruthlessly
been on the point of separating his nephew
from Dolores; and here, perhaps, he might eventually
be separated from the old love he had so recently
found again!
</p>

<p>
But Mercedes placed her hand in his, in token
that they would never separate in life again.
</p>

<p>
So the old Brigade, of gallant memory, was going
home <i>en masse</i> at last&mdash;home to Scotland, with its
mighty crop of laurels, gathered in the Lowlands of
Holland, France, and Spain; home after two hundred
years of foreign service, during which, as the Scottish
commander-in-chief soon after told its soldiers in
Edinburgh, they had captured in battle and siege
many a standard, but <i>never lost one</i>.
</p>

<p>
The brilliant sun of a July evening was shining on
the broad blue waters of the Maese, and the pale-green
willow groves that fringe its banks; on the tossing
sails of many a windmill far afield; on the red
mansions and spires of Rotterdam, the great brick tower
of St. Laurence, and the high gables of the Hoeg
Straat; on the long line of the Boompjies with all
their stately elms, when the old Scots Brigade, with
the drums of all its battalions waking Dutch echoes
for the last time to 'The Lowlands of Holland,'
marched to the landing-place for embarkation,
accompanied by vast crowds of sympathising, admiring,
regretful, and kindly-hearted Dutch folk; for a
thousand old historical, warlike, and, better than all,
friendly ties and associations were, on that evening,
to be severed for ever!
</p>

<p>
Before that day of embarkation came, two marriages,
which created the deepest interest in the departing
Brigade (which the brides accompanied), had been
celebrated at the Schotsche Kirk of the Hague, by its
pastor, the Reverend Ichabod Crane: on which
occasion there were present the Burgomaster; Heer van
Otterbeck, the Minister of State; and two or three of
their Mightinesses of the States-General.
</p>

<p>
Need we say whose marriages these were?

<h3>
THE STORY OF THE CID RODRIGO OF BIVAR.
</h3>

<p>
It is in old Castile, and on the banks of the rapid
Ebro, that our story opens, during the wonderful era
of the Cid Campeador, when in Spain there were
about twenty kings, some of whom were Christians,
but more were Mohammedans; and in the land were
many independent warlike lords, who roved about on
horseback, completely armed, with trains of knights,
offering their services to princes and princesses who
were at war.
</p>

<p>
This custom, says Voltaire, had already spread over
Europe, but nowhere to such an extent as in Spain;
the Christian knights were dubbed as such, with many
solemn ceremonies, 'and watched their arms before
the altar of the Virgin Mary; but the Moslem paladins
were content with simply girding on a scimitar.  This
was the origin of knights-errant and of such numbers
of single combats.'
</p>

<p>
What with twenty kings all warring among themselves;
lawless robbers in the Sierras to fight; Jews
to capture, torture, and mulct; knights-errant
besetting the highways and bridges with shield uplifted
to meet all comers; Moors on every hand to slay without
mercy, but more particularly at Seville, Granada,
and Valencia, and the still more abhorred Morabathans,
the restless spirits who wished to be up and doing,
for good or for evil, amid the din of kettledrums and
cymbals, the glitter of lances and banners and so
forth, must have had plenty of work cut out for them
in the sunny Spain of those days, long ere Cervantes
had laughed her 'chivalry away.'
</p>

<p>
Near the right bank of the Ebro, about ten miles
from Burgos, at the base of the Montanos de
Santander, stood the Convent of Miraflores; and though
many times repaired and renewed, it stands there
still: but it was in the zenith of its fame when one
day in the June of that year, while Sancho, the
ambitious King of Castile, was preparing to besiege
Zamora, an armed knight reined up his horse on its
most sequestered side, where one solitary window
overlooked the river and all the groves of olive and
myrtle that grew thereby.
</p>

<p>
Though we write of a period so remote, strange to
say the window is there still in the old wall, against
which the Moors have more than once hurled their
strength in vain, and it projects like a carved stone
cage of three pointed arches, supported by the head
and wings of a time-worn and gigantic figure of
grotesque design; and thereat was a fair young face,
that grew bright with joy when the young knight drew
near.
</p>

<p>
The latter was a typical Spaniard, vigorous, tall, and
well developed in figure; black haired, with eyes full
of fire; dark, well-defined eyebrows, and features sharp
and grave.  Save that he wore a species of Moorish
basinet, bright as silver, with a tippet of mail; he was
clothed in chain armour to the tips of his fingers and
the soles of his feet, for the land teemed with fighting
and peril, and no man ventured abroad save completely
equipped.  His spurs were goads without
rowels, and a cross-hilted sword hung in his glittering
belt.
</p>

<p>
The girl who welcomed his approach was not a
<i>religieuse</i>, for young ladies were boarded in convents
then as now; but her costume declared her to be of
rank, as it was of shiny, golden-yellow silk, trimmed
with black of the same material, tightly sleeved to the
wrist; and she wore her thick, dark hair plaited in
several divisions, after the old Gothic custom that
lingered still in Spain.
</p>

<p>
Her complexion was fair and bright; her features
delicate and harmonious; she was bewitching rather
than beautiful&mdash;quite enough so to be the heroine
even of a romance! and the <i>Madre Abadesa</i> of
Miraflores, who had very special instructions given her
regarding the care of this young lady, had accorded
her the secluded apartment with the projecting window&mdash;a
circumstance which led to the young knight
discovering and making her acquaintance, a fact that
would have filled the good lady with intense dismay&mdash;for
by flirting their falcons, the young pair had come
to a flirtation, and rather more, between themselves.
</p>

<p>
In those days he who bore the hawk on his left
wrist in the most graceful way, was deemed the most
accomplished cavalier; and to please ladies, it was
the fashion to play flirty tricks with the pinions of
their hawks.  Thus, more than once, when passing,
had the strange knight's hawk flown upward to the
full length of its silken jess to flirt with the merlin on
the hand of the lady, and hence it came to pass that
the owners met as we find them.  In those days
people seem to have fallen in love more suddenly and
desperately than they do in our railway times, and
their love seemed always to delight in struggling
with difficulties.
</p>

<p>
There was much of the Romeo and Juliet passionate
tenderness in the suddenly-developed regard of these
two, but we cannot suppose that the lovers of those
days spoke more 'on stilts' than those of the present
time.  The old story that was first told in Eden will
have ever the tender trivialities and endearing epithets,
so we shall imagine all these said, and come to prose
at once.
</p>

<p>
'Your name, señor mio&mdash;dear love rather&mdash;in all
your visits you have never yet told it to me?' she
said softly.
</p>

<p>
'I have to win it yet,' he replied.
</p>

<p>
'Where?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'Where does a hidalgo win his name save in battle
against the Moorish curs?  When so won, you shall
know it.  But yours, sweet lady?'
</p>

<p>
'May not, must not, be told to one who conceals
his own.'
</p>

<p>
'But I must call you something, Estrella mia,'
said he tenderly.
</p>

<p>
'Then your "star" be it,' said she, laughing and
kissing her hand to him, 'and my love and my prayers
go with you to battle.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, I go not to battle just now.'
</p>

<p>
'Whither then, and armed thus?'
</p>

<p>
'To fulfil a vow of vengeance on a craven who smote
my aged father on the beard with his mailed hand.'
</p>

<p>
'Is it not better to forgive?'
</p>

<p>
'Some things, perhaps, but not a deed like that!
Ay de mi, is it not hard for you to be shut up in this
solitary place, dependent on yourself for all joy and
amusement?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, señor mio, I am content; and is not contentment
joy?  I shall never be happier than I am, till I
rejoin my dear old father.'
</p>

<p>
'Where?' asked the knight.
</p>

<p>
'To tell that would be to disclose myself.'
</p>

<p>
'Tie a ribbon to my lance-head, thou dear one, and
I shall dip it in the blood of him I have vowed to
slay.'
</p>

<p>
She did so, saying in the spirit of the age:
</p>

<p>
'Rival, if you can, the Cid Rodrigo, who has been
known to meet ten knights in arms, and unhorse them
all; who, with his sword, slew that giant Moor, the
Caliph of Cordova, and released six Christian maidens.'
</p>

<p>
The knight laughed lightly.
</p>

<p>
'Dios guarde à ustéd, mi querida!' he exclaimed,
gathering up his reins, and spurring his horse&mdash;the
Babieca of so many ballads and romances&mdash;for sooth
to say, he was the identical Cid Rodrigo of whom she
spoke; and waving a farewell to 'the sweet face at
the window,' he rode off with lance and helmet flashing
in the sun, and she watched him till he disappeared
in the direction of Miranda&mdash;watched him departing
on his deadly mission with less anxiety, perhaps, than
a girl of the present day would see her lover start by
express train.
</p>

<p>
The Convent of Miraflores, with its garden and
vineyard, formed a kind of oasis in the long sweeping
plain at the foot of the rugged Sierra; shy bustards
stalked about there in the loneliness amid the silent
scenery, for silent it is in Spain, where there are no
singing birds.  A train of mules crossing the waste,
where the wild mignonette grows still in sheets of
green; a solitary horseman in mail, with lance-head
glittering in the sun, or a friar jogging along on a
mule, alone were seen from time to time from the
convent windows.
</p>

<p>
Gentle and soft in disposition, the fair <i>pensionaria</i>
had a deal of pent-up tenderness at her disposal.
Hitherto it had been bestowed upon pet birds and
flowers, mingled with many prayers in chapel and
much musing and reverie at the projecting window,
where she would sit for hours in that non-literary
age, when there were no books, no Berlin wool-work,
and no pianos, gazing at the sparkling stars of the
summer night or at the morning sun, as he tipped the
transparent foliage of the myrtle groves and lit up the
current of the Ebro; till a day came when she was
roused and excited by finding a gallant hawk, hooded
and plumed, flirting with the merlin on her wrist, and
saw its owner, the young mailed horseman, below the
window regarding her with pleasure and admiration;
and as he had some trouble in luring back his bird, a
secret acquaintance, that ripened into love, began
between these two.  The girl&mdash;for she was but a girl,
and very young too&mdash;loved with all her newly-awakened
woman's heart and with a wild yearning,
very different, perhaps, from that of a young woman
of the present day, for her life was one of intense
seclusion, and he rapidly became (like Romeo) 'the
god of her idolatry' in the unreasoning enthusiasm of
those days of romance and chivalry.
</p>

<p>
How little could she dream that her lover was the
Cid Rodrigo of Bivar, with the fame of whose
exploits all Spain resounded now!
</p>

<p>
He was born at Burgos, where his father, Don
Diego Lainez, was a powerful noble, and his mother
was Donna Teresa, 'daughter of the Conde Don Nuno
Alvarez,' as the inscription on her tomb bears now in
the church of San Pedro de Cordova, near Burgos.
</p>

<p>
In the year our story opens, the aged Don Diego
had been grossly insulted by the haughty and powerful
Count of Gormaz, better known as Don Lozano
Gomez, who dared, with his iron gauntlet, to smite
him on the face in presence of Sancho the King and
his Court.  Mingled fury and deep dejection filled the
heart of the old man at this unparalleled affront; he
refused food; sleep left his eyelids, and hourly he
brooded on his dire disgrace, till his son Rodrigo
vowed to avenge him.  Before the miraculous crucifix
which is still in the Cathedral of Burgos, and which
tradition avers to have been fashioned by St. Nicodemus,
he had sworn to do this&mdash;and so strongly were the
minds of men constituted in those days, that even as
he registered the evil vow, his heart was filled by a
glow of reverence and adoration&mdash;and then he rode
forth in search of their enemy, for these were not times
like our own, when young fellows affect to be so much
'used up' in all the joys and sorrows of the world that
nothing excites them.
</p>

<p>
Quitting the vicinity of the Convent of Miraflores, he
took the way to Miranda del Ebro, and had not ridden
many miles when he saw an armed knight approaching,
attended by four esquires, or men-at-arms, and a
sense of fierce joy filled the soul of the Cid on
recognising, by the blazoning of his surcoat, the very man of
whom he was in search, Don Lozano, the Conde de
Gormaz, delivered over to him, as he believed, specially
by the hand of Heaven!  Goldsmith tells us that 'it
is easier to conceive than describe the complicated
sensations which are felt from the pain of a recent
injury and the pleasure of approaching vengeance;'
and some such mingled emotion there was in the
heart of the knight.
</p>

<p>
Reining up his horse in the centre of the narrow and
dusty road, Rodrigo cried:
</p>

<p>
'Don Lozano&mdash;craven dog, who smote my father,
defend yourself!'
</p>

<p>
'Begone, rash youth, lest I have you disarmed and
scourged!' replied Lozano, lowering his lance however,
as he knew that he who barred the way would not
stand on trifles.  'We are five to one.'
</p>

<p>
'Villain, come on! on my side are right and
nobility&mdash;worth a hundred comrades!' cried Rodrigo; and
meeting at full speed with a dreadful shock, the
splinters of their lances flew twenty feet into the air.
Rodrigo then drew his sword, the famous Tisona, and
almost ere Lozano's blade had left its sheath, he was
hewn down from his saddle and bleeding in the dust,
while his armed attendants in terror took to flight.
Rodrigo then tore the surcoat from the dying Count,
as a token of his victory&mdash;Mariana the historian, we
think, adds that he cut off his head&mdash;and then rode
leisurely homeward to Burgos; for if a little homicide
by way of duello was thought little of here when
George III. was King, it was a matter of decidedly
less consequence in Spain in the days of the Cid.
</p>

<p>
At the head of three hundred mounted hidalgos,
'all wearing gold and silken raiment, with perfumed
gloves, and caps of gorgeous colours,' Don Diego, now,
as he thought, redeemed from disgrace, rode forth to
meet the King and kiss his hand, while Rodrigo repaired
to the Convent of Miraflores, with the blood-stained
ribbon streaming from his casque, but the face was
not at the window now.  Thrice he came thither and
watched and waited for it in vain, and believing that
the Mother Abbess had discovered his love-affair, he
returned with a heavy heart to Burgos, to take counsel
of the King Sancho, though some say it was of this
latter's father, King Ferdinand.
</p>

<p>
But soon tidings came to the Court of Castile that a
beautiful lady, who had been foully wronged, was
coming hither attended by a numerous train, to seek
justice at the hands of the King.  All the young
knights were ready to embrace her cause, whatever it
might be; but all, including the famous Bellido Dolfos,
withdrew in favour of Rodrigo, who first demanded
to make it his own; and yet he thought, 'God wot,
why should I champion her, when my own and only
love is the Recluse of Miraflores?'  And then the
sweet face at the window came before him in memory
with all the soft brightness of an opium-eater's
dream.
</p>

<p>
Clad in black, with a gauze veil over her dark
dishevelled tresses, her eyes streaming with tears, the
lady fell on her knees before the King, exclaiming, as
the Spanish ballad has it:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Justice, King!  I am for justice&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vengeance on a traitor knight!<br>
  Grant it me!  So shall thy children<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrive and prove thy soul's delight.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Her voice found a painful echo in the heart of
Rodrigo, who was filled with sudden horror.
</p>

<p>
'Estrella mia!' he exclaimed, as she threw up her
veil; 'can such sorrow be?  Are you Ximena Gomez?'
</p>

<p>
'And <i>you</i>&mdash;you&mdash;the slayer of my hapless father!
O mi padre murio!' she cried in a piercing voice, as
they both made this terrible discovery.  Filial affection
had been a ruling passion in the gentle mind of
Ximena, who now experienced a dreadful shock on
finding that it was by the hand of her lover, her father
had perished.  And great too was the grief and
dismay of the young Cid at a catastrophe&mdash;a revelation
so unexpected.  A blight fell upon the hearts of both.
Lozano had no son to avenge his death.  He left only
the helpless and weeping Ximena, whom the King
raised up, and who now ceased to demand on Rodrigo
the punishment she had craved before, and returned
to Miraflores, vowing that she would take the veil,
while Rodrigo, accompanied by his comrades, Bellido
Dolfos, Pedro Bermudez, and Martin Pelaez, Ordono,
and others, plunged at once into a series of warlike
exploits and expeditions, seeking to appease thereby
the memory of the sorrow that had fallen upon them
all.  'Of all the knights, the Cid distinguished himself
most against the Mussulmans,' says Voltaire briefly.
'Many of them ranged themselves under his banner,
and altogether, with their squires and horsemen in
armour, composed an army covered with iron and
mounted on the finest horses in the country.  The
Cid conquered more than one Moorish king, and
having at last fortified himself in the city of Alcazar,
formed there a little sovereignty.'
</p>

<p>
Spanish history makes the conquered kings five in
number, and states that he caused them to pay tribute
after he set them at liberty, 'wherefore they served him
faithfully, and called him their Cid, or Lord.'  It also
records that Ximena did not take the veil at Miraflores,
but, curiously enough, exhibited another strange
sample of the manners of the age by petitioning the
King 'either to execute Rodrigo for killing her father,
or give him to her for a husband.  The King chose
the latter, and Rodrigo joyfully received Ximena and
took her to his mother, who kept her as her own child,
and they were betrothed; but Rodrigo promised to
gain many more battles against the Moors before he
would claim her as his wife.'  And so, while the Cid
was winning five provinces, and gaining glory too,
with the edge of Tisona among the infidels&mdash;of whom
he slew an incredible number, till a saying of his is a
Spanish proverb to this day, 'The more Moors the
more gain'&mdash;Ximena spent her time in fear and hope
among her favourite flowers and love-birds at the
house of Donna Teresa, in Burgos (Coronico de los
Moros, etc.).
</p>

<p>
And even after their marriage it was his boast,
'God wot! oftener is Tisona than Ximena by my
side.'
</p>

<p>
After the siege of Zamora, during which King
Sancho was slain&mdash;treacherously, it is averred, by
Don Bellido Dolfos&mdash;the Cid, as the former was
repairing to Burgos, gave him a special message to
Ximena:
</p>

<p>
'Tell her that I am coming; and, as an earnest
thereof, give her this ring, which I took from the hand
of the Caliph of Cordova.'
</p>

<p>
Don Billido, who in his heart cherished a secret and
treacherous love for the betrothed of his friend, took
the ring, and, saying emphatically, 'Rodrigo, amigo
mio, haya cuenta sobre mi' (<i>i.e.</i>, 'My friend, rely on
me'), rode gaily home to Burgos.
</p>

<p>
Bellido has been described as a man with a fierce
hooked nose, a black beard, and slightly treacherous
eyes, that, if such are the true index of the soul, might
have revealed his natural character.
</p>

<p>
He gave the ring to Ximena, and told her that the
Cid awaited her at Miraflores.  She was surprised at
this, but, never doubting the comrade of her intended
husband, attended by two ladies, she set out for
Miraflores, closely veiled.  They rode white palfreys, with
velvet caparisons embroidered with gold, and having
silken bridles covered with little bells.  Bellido and
some ruffians, on whom he could rely, formed their
escort; but they never reached Miraflores.
</p>

<p>
In due time the Cid Rodrigo came to Burgos with
his heart full of Ximena, his old love for her mingling
with gratitude that she had forgiven him for the terrible
wrong he had done her, and already he seemed to see
her winning smile and her soft and lustrous eyes, that
looked so truthfully under the long, dark lashes that
fringed them.
</p>

<p>
'Madre mia, where is Ximena?' he exclaimed, as
he alighted from his horse.
</p>

<p>
'At Miraflores, whither you sent for her,' was the
reply.
</p>

<p>
'I sent no such message&mdash;there is some mistake.'
</p>

<p>
'Or treachery,' said Donna Teresa; 'my mind
misgives me, or I distrust Don Bellido.'
</p>

<p>
'Can he have decoyed her away!' exclaimed the
Cid, with alarm and rage in his voice and eye.
</p>

<p>
But the old lady knew not what to think, and began
to weep bitterly; and still more did she weep when
sure tidings came that in revenge for repelling his
addresses, the double traitor Bellido Dolfos had
betrayed Ximena into the hands of Hiaja, the savage
Caliph of Toledo.
</p>

<p>
Rodrigo was beside himself with sorrow and
dismay; but bethought him at once of his sword, and
prevailed upon his new master, Alphonso VI., King
of Old Castile, to besiege the city of Toledo, offering
him all his knights for that enterprise.
</p>

<p>
The report of this siege, and the cause thereof&mdash;a
Christian lady of rare beauty and high rank, more
than all, the betrothed of the Cid, being a captive in
the hands of the odious Hiaja&mdash;brought many knights
and princes from distant lands, particularly Raymond,
Count of Toulouse, and two princes of the royal blood
of France, of the branch of Burgundy.
</p>

<p>
Their armies covered all the fertile plain amid which
Toledo stands, on a steep hill, round the base of
which flows the Tagus.  In some places the spears of
the infantry&mdash;whose massed columns seemed like a
sea of glittering steel&mdash;stood thick as upright corn;
in others were the squadrons of barbed horse, the
knights and men-at-arms, all clothed in chain armour,
bright as winter frost or polished silver, their
many-coloured plumes, their square banners, and
swallow-tailed pennons streaming out upon the wind.
</p>

<p>
High overall, with its towers and the minarets of its
mosques, rose the then infidel city of Toledo, the upper
part of which was then, as now, girt by Roman, and
the lower part by Moorish walls.  History tells us
that when Alphonso VI. had been a fugitive under
the persecution of his brother and predecessor, Sancho,
he had found an asylum at the Court of the Caliph of
Toledo, who treated him with hospitality and princely
distinction; and now more than one Moorish warrior
rode forth from the city to reproach Alphonso with
ingratitude to his benefactor, and many a terrible and
remarkable combat was fought under the walls of
Toledo, among the defenders of which was Don Bellido
Dolfos, who had renounced his faith and adopted the
turban.
</p>

<p>
In the combats before the city, the Cid was daily
occupied, and many a Moorish warrior, horse and
man, rolled in the dust beneath his lance or battle-axe;
and his followers were enriched by the spoil, the
rare weapons, the costly garments and jewels, that his
hand won.
</p>

<p>
At last there came a day&mdash;the anniversary of the
victory won by Mohammed at Bedr, between Mecca
and Medina&mdash;when the Moors made a dreadful sortie
from Toledo, led by the renegade, Bellido Dolfos; and
closing in on every hand, the Christians met them with
equal ardour and fury.
</p>

<p>
The hand-to-hand fighting was terrible, and the
Christian knights, led by the Cid, the Count of
Toulouse, and others, dashed their horses through and
through the living tide of Moors that surged around
them.  Gorgeous as a field of flowers, with their
many-coloured turbans and flowing garments, seemed the
Moors as they kept shoulder to shoulder, guarding
their heads with round shields covered with glittering
bosses, their sharp scimitars flashing in the sun, their
shouts rolling like thunder between the Tagus and the
walls of Toledo, as they fought with demoniac strength
and ferocity, but fought in vain.  High over all the
throng towered the Cid upon Babieca, its mailed flanks
stuck full of arrows and even broken lances.
</p>

<p>
'Santiágo y cerra España!' he shouted ever and
anon&mdash;the old war-cry of Spain&mdash;and he hewed on all
sides with Tisona, till his sword-arm grew weary, and
the last who bit the dust beneath it was the traitor
Don Bellido, after whose fall the Moors were driven
headlong into Toledo.
</p>

<p>
The siege lasted a year, during which Ximena and
her two attendants occupied a noble chamber in the
palace of the Caliph.  Its ceiling was adorned with
arabesques and fretwork, brilliant with gold and delicate
pencilling.  In its centre was an alabaster fountain
of perfumed water, and round it were cages of gold
and silver wire, full of singing birds; and there daily
the three ladies offered up their prayers on their knees
for the success of the Christian arms, and for their
own release.
</p>

<p>
After a year and a day Toledo capitulated, and
Ximena was restored to the Cid, to whom all New
Castile submitted, and who took possession of it in
the name of Alphonso VI.; and Madrid, then a small
village, one day to become the capital of Spain, was
for the first time in the hands of the Christians, and
Hiaja was the last Caliph of Toledo.
</p>

<p>
To narrate all the heroic deeds performed by the
Cid after his marriage would require the space of a
very large volume indeed.  The great dominions he
acquired for his royal master the latter increased by
espousing Zaid, a daughter of the Moorish King of
Andalusia, after which Rodrigo, at the head of his
knights, subdued the whole of Valentia.  No sovereign
prince in Spain was more powerful than he; but he
contented himself with the title of Cid, and never
assumed that of King, though he might easily have
done so.  No warrior in Spain did more evil to the
Moors, yet he occasionally joined the Beni Huds of
Zaragossa against the Counts of Barcelona, whom he
conquered twice.  While he never failed in his word
to a Christian, he mercilessly despoiled the Jews, from
two of whom he raised money for war, by depositing
with them two chests which were alleged to be full of
plate, but which contained only stones and sand.
</p>

<p>
His two daughters became queens of Aragon and
Navarre.
</p>

<p>
Five years after the conquest of Valentia, worn out
by incessant warfare, he fell ill, and was abed when
tidings were brought to him that Bucar, the Moor,
whom he had expelled from that kingdom, was
advancing to regain it with a mighty army of horse
and foot; but Tisona lay idly in the scabbard now.
For seven days preceding his death, the Cid would
taste nothing but a little myrrh and balsam; and on
the day he departed he took a solemn farewell of
Ximena, his kinsmen, and all his knights, whom he
requested to carefully bury his old war-horse Babieca,
'to the end that no dogs might eat the flesh of him
whose hoofs had trodden down so much dog's-flesh of
the Moors.'  He bequeathed a coffer of silver to the
two Jews, and desired that his body should be borne
to San Pedro de Cardena, and laid beside that of his
mother.
</p>

<p>
He died in the year 1097; but he who had been the
terror of the Moors for so many years when in life, was
still fated to strike terror to them in death, even while
all the host of King Bucar were rejoicing that he had
passed away.  At midnight, twelve days after that
event, the Christians prepared to abandon the city of
Valentia&mdash;'Valentia of the Cid,' as it is called to this
day.  His body, which had been placed, we are told,
'in a sitting posture, and left to stiffen between two
boards,' was placed on the back of Babieca, upright in
the saddle, with the feet tied in the stirrups.  To all
appearance he was completely armed; a light shield
of parchment, painted with his device, was hung on
his left arm; the terrible Tisona was fixed bare and
upright in his sword-hand.  Geronymo, Bishop of
Valentia, led Babieca by the rein; Pedro Bermudez,
with the banner of the Cid upraised, led the van with
400 knights; then came the Cid's body, with Ximena
and her ladies, guarded by 600 men, and when day
broke, though the Moors were terrified to find that the
Cid was there in his saddle again, a battle ensued, and
King Bucar was defeated; but Valentia was lost, and
the sorrowing warriors of Rodrigo continued their
retreat to Old Castile and beyond the Ebro.
</p>

<p>
At Olmedo they were met by his daughters, with all
the knights of Aragon, clad in black cloaks, with
hoods rent, and their shields reversed at their saddle
bows; and with every religious and military solemnity
incident to the time, they laid him in his grave at San
Pedro de Cardena, and two years afterwards Gil Diaz,
one of his most faithful followers, buried Babieca
before the gate of the church there.  In the course of
seven centuries and a half the remains of the famous
Cid Rodrigo have been removed several times, the
last occasion being by the French, in 1809, to the
Espolen, or public promenade of Burgos; but in 1826
they were restored to San Pedro, where the tomb and
effigies of himself and Ximena now remain in a small
but noble chapel.  In that chapel lie the bones of
Alvar Fanez Minaya, whom he was wont to call his
'right arm;' of Pedro Bermudez, Ordono, Martin
Pelaez, the Asturian, and many more of his captains
and valiant friends.
</p>

<p>
His statue, as 'the dread and terror of the Moorish
curs,' has a prominent place in the quaint gateway of
Santa Maria, erected by Charles V. at Burgos.  In the
time of Cervantes the saddle of Babieca was preserved
in the Royal Armoury at Madrid, and Southey avers
that he had personally seen and handled Tisona, now
an heirloom in the family of the Marquis de Falces.
On one side of the blade is graven, 'I am Tisona, made
in the year 1002;' on the other is the legend, 'AVE
MARIA GRATIA PLENA DOMINUS TUUM.'

<h3>
THE BOY-GENERAL.
<br><br>
THE STORY OF JEAN CAVALIER.
</h3>

<p>
'Guillot&mdash;you here!  Why have you left the
mountain of St. Julian?'
</p>

<p>
'To be with you, brother Jean&mdash;to fight for the
Cevennes.'
</p>

<p>
'With a beardless face and a feeble hand!'
</p>

<p>
'I have about as much beard as you, mon frère;
and if my hand be feeble, it has brought down many a
wolf in Mialet and the Gevaudan,' replied Guillot,
slapping the butt of his carbine emphatically.
</p>

<p>
The speakers were young Guillot Cavalier and his
elder brother Jean, who was then, at the age of <i>seventeen
years</i>, actually a general and second in command
of the Camisard army, the Insurgent Protestants of
Languedoc; who fought many a battle with Villars
and De Montrevel, the best leaders of the age; who,
with Roland, led the great revolt in 1703; and who
in his twentieth year became a full colonel in the
English army!
</p>

<p>
Both were very handsome lads, and both wore the
white tunic (in Languedocian, <i>camisa</i>) to distinguish
themselves from their enemies, and hence their
well-known name of Camisards.  Both were well armed,
with swords, silver-mounted pistols, and short
carbines; but the elder wore over his shoulder the scarf
of a French general, and in his white velvet cap the
wing of an eagle.  Strong&mdash;and tender as strong&mdash;was
the bond of affection between these two lads, who
had both been born in the village of Ribaute, among
the pastoral mountains north of the Valley of Garden;
and though Jean was ready to face any peril and to
'do all that may become a man' for the cause in
which he had been so suddenly made a leader, and in
which he had already won such high distinction, his
heart sank at the contemplation of Guillot&mdash;a delicate
boy, and their mother's chief care&mdash;encountering the
risks of that most savage and rancorous Civil War
which now devastated Languedoc.
</p>

<p>
Jean, as a very little boy, had been bred a shepherd,
and was afterwards apprenticed to a baker at Anduze;
and it was from the employ of the latter that, with
a carbine in his hand, he went forth to become a
Camisard, 'and soon proved himself to be,' as history
tells us, 'a most able general, as well as a powerful
prophet and preacher.'
</p>

<p>
'Return, Guillot&mdash;return,' he is said to have urged
again; 'our poor mother cannot spare us both.'
</p>

<p>
'La Bonne Madelon is the mother we must serve
just now, and I will not quit your camp,' replied
Guillot, whose eyes lit up, as he referred to one of
those wild, half-frenzied, and wholly enthusiastic
prophetesses, or female preachers, who thronged the camps
of the Camisards, attended their councils, and followed
them into battle.
</p>

<p>
'Then be it so,' said Jean Cavalier resignedly;
adding, 'I have good news for you and all the faithful,
Guillot.  The Queen of Great Britain&mdash;the good Queen
Anne&mdash;is sending a fleet to our aid.'
</p>

<p>
'Of what use will it be to us among the mountains?'
asked Guillot, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'It brings us troops, Guillot&mdash;troops, who will help
us to beat those of Montrevel,' replied Jean, referring
to the expedition consisting of thirty-five British and
twelve Dutch ships of the line, which was to sail on
the 1st of July, 1703, from St. Helens, to the
assistance of the Cevennois, and to the arrival of this
expedition off the coast the elder Cavalier looked
confidently forward to repulsing the column of
De Montrevel, while Roland was fighting the King's
troops elsewhere.  And now to explain briefly what
brought all these affairs about.
</p>

<p>
In the 'Histoire des Pasteurs du Désert,' and other
annals, we are told the terrible story of that Civil
War in which 30,000 Cevennois perished in battle
or on the scaffold, between November, 1702, and
December, 1704.  Well fitted for desultory warfare
are the mountains of Cevennes, with their rocky
labyrinth of deep gorges and dark defiles, which a mere
handful of bold peasantry were able to hold against
the best troops of Louis XIV., and where, to this
hour, the population is almost entirely Protestant,
inhabiting some six hundred villages, which are all
but inaccessible.
</p>

<p>
The white-shirted Camisards had these steep ridges
to encamp on; gorges for ambuscades; forests to
rally in; paths trodden only by the wolf or the fox to
retreat by; and caverns which became their arsenals
and fortresses.  Army after army came to annihilate
these peasants as heretics, after the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes, but only to be destroyed or hurled
in ruin and defeat into the valleys; but the miseries
of the war, the slaughter of women and children, the
burning and pillaging were fearful, and spread from
thence to the ocean on the south, and the Rhone on
the east, among the hundred churches of Dauphine.
With much sublime piety and heroic valour the armed
peasantry, as in the similar case of the Scottish
Covenanters, combined a great amount of psalm-singing
and the strongest religious fervour, bordering at times
upon fanaticism, and prophets and prophetesses, like
La Bonne Madelon, roused a wildness of enthusiasm
never seen in France since the days of Joan of Arc.
'The spirit of resistance began to show itself, drawn
forth by the recital of their wrongs, the denunciation
of their tyrants, and the assurance of support from
heaven; conventicles were held, in spite of the terrors
of prison, torture, and the soldiery, and in the open
air among the rocks and caverns.'
</p>

<p>
Roland and Cavalier levied their troops from the
different parishes, each of which furnished its quota of
armed men and money, and fresh heroes to fill up the
vacancies in the ranks.  Many believed themselves to
be sword or bullet proof, while 'the seizures, tortures,
executions by breaking on the wheel and burning
alive (the common modes of punishing a Camisard),
led to reprisals on their part&mdash;to the slaying of priests
and the sacking and burning of Catholic churches.'  But
in the spirit of outrage, the French troops were
far surpassed by the guerilla bands, called Florentins,
in the pay of the Grand Monarque.
</p>

<p>
Jean Cavalier thought of these things keenly now,
as he gazed on the soft boyish face of his brother
Guillot, when posting his column of Camisards in
ambush one morning, ere dawn, to give a hot welcome
to the royal forces under the Sieur de Montrevel, an
officer high in repute for great valour, but merciless in
his severity.
</p>

<p>
The sound of the drums had died away, but the
sheeny bayonets glistened in the sun, and the white
Bourbon colours of the regiments, with their golden
fleur-de-lys, were waving in the wind, as the column
of royal troops began to penetrate a defile that was
clothed with the olive, the vine, and the fig-tree.
The church and hamlet there had perished by fire;
the place was desolate; not a human being was
visible, and without halting, the troops pushed on,
with an advanced guard to 'feel the way,' in front,
till they reached a portion of the defile where the
impending rocks were higher, the way narrower, and
the trailing vines had given place to the dense, dark,
and woody luxuriance of forest trees.  The flower of
the column was composed of one of the four battalions
of the ancient regiment of Champagne, raised
so far back as the reign of Henry II.
</p>

<p>
'Halt!' cried the officer of the advanced guard,
whose quick eye had detected the bright flash of steel
amid the green branches.  In another moment, a
combination of fearful sounds burst like a storm
upon the silent air, while the soldiers halted, panting
with the exertion of climbing the long and steep
ascent.  An enormous fragment of rock, dislodged
from above, crashed with the sound of thunder into
the defile below, a mass that must have annihilated
the entire advanced guard, had the officer not halted
it in time.  Other masses of rock and rubbish came
thundering down, barring all advance, while more
than a thousand voices made the defile re-echo with
the shouts of fierce exultation, mingled with a religious
hymn.
</p>

<p>
On the fallen rock in front there was suddenly seen
a female, 'the Good Madelon,' kneeling in an attitude
of frenzied supplication, her arms thrown wildly up,
her hands clasped, her black hair floating loose, her
drapery streaming on the wind, and by her side stood
Cavalier.  As yet no shots had been fired.
</p>

<p>
'Voilà!  'Tis the rebel Cavalier!' cried De Montrevel,
almost leaping in his saddle with exultation;
and his sharp words of command followed fast.
</p>

<p>
A volley was poured in front and on both flanks,
and from these three points it was closely responded
to; and then the soldiers, who were in great force,
began, at the bayonet's point, to push up the woody
sides of the defile, firing as they went and driving the
peasantry before them; and meanwhile the prophetess&mdash;she
of the supposed charmed life, La Bonne Madelon,
remained on her knees immovable, absorbed in prayer,
half seen, half hidden, amid the eddying smoke.
Guillot strove to lead her aside, but in vain; and when
a bullet grazed his cheek, he rushed away to join his
brother, who, like him, strongly believed in the power
of immunity from death possessed by Madelon, and
was now busy in the act of concentrating and
directing the operations of his scattered followers.
</p>

<p>
It is said that when the prophetess, whose eyes had
in them the gleam of insanity, felt the bullets whiz
about her, a sense of danger came with the sound, and
that she opened her eyes and glanced about her, as if
seeking to escape, but she was grasped by four
soldiers of the line; and that when the Camisards
beheld her feeble hands bound with cords, while her
head sunk on her breast, and she was dragged away,
they became for a time panic-stricken, and though
they hovered on the precipice above the corpse-strewn
defile, they ceased to fire, and gazed on her
conveyance to the rear in a species of stupid
wonder.
</p>

<p>
'She can save herself,' Cavalier is reported to have
said, so perfect was his belief, as a credulous
mountaineer, in her divine mission; 'we cannot rescue her
now, but,' he added, lifting his cap and looking
upward, 'some miracle from heaven will.'
</p>

<p>
But no miracle was wrought, and with his solitary
prisoner the Sieur de Montrevel marched down,
somewhat triumphantly, to the nearest town, the white
houses of which could be seen a league or two distant
from the mountains.  That night Guillot, with a chosen
party, stole from them, and entered the silent street,
from which all the inhabitants had fled, hoping to find
some trace of the Good Madelon, perhaps in the public
prison, from which they might see a way to free her.
</p>

<p>
But Montrevel and his men had departed, leaving
in the market-place a fearful object, which greeted the
eyes of Guillot and his followers when daybreak came
in.  Suspended by the neck from a gibbet in the
centre of the place hung the body of their prophetess
in its well-known drapery, and literally full of bullets,
as the departing Florentins had made a target of it.
She had been a beautiful woman, whose husband and
children had been cruelly destroyed before her, and
sorrow had doubtless turned her brain.
</p>

<p>
Accustomed though they had become to atrocities,
the Camisards gazed at each other in horror at this
spectacle, and then bore away her body for interment,
sadly, slowly, and reverentially, and from the side of
her grave went up the united vow for vengeance!
</p>

<p>
The fleet of Sir Cloudesley Shovel failed to land
either succour or allies, and returning to England,
says Schomberg, in his 'Naval Chronology,' was off
the Isle of Wight on the 16th of November; so the
Camisards now had no hopes but in their own hearts
and hands.
</p>

<p>
Intent on avenging the barbarous death of the Good
Madelon, Jean Cavalier, with 1,500 Camisards, took
post near La Tour de Bellot, a deserted sheep-farm
and watch-tower to the westward of Alais, from
whence he meant to issue and attack De Montrevel,
who was, he believed, ignorant of his vicinity, and
who, keeping somewhat careless guard, was encamped
not far off among the mountains.  In the afternoon
the Camisards were plentifully supplied with food by
a wealthy miller on the Garden, whom they believed
to be true to their cause.  By nightfall, Cavalier had
reconnoitred all the country; and as the sun set, dark
clouds gathered fast, and premature twilight shrouded
the valleys.  Through them the wind howled, foreboding
a storm, and Cavalier laughed with stern joy,
when telling his followers that their attack would be
veiled by the war of the elements.
</p>

<p>
He had laid out his plans with wisdom, and alone,
and a little apart from his troops, was waiting the
time to give them the signal to move, when from all
points around the Tour de Bellot burst forth a
half-random storm of musketry, and the boom of cannon
announced that the King's troops were upon him!
</p>

<p>
'We are betrayed!' cried Guillot, rushing
bare-headed to his side.
</p>

<p>
'By whom?'
</p>

<p>
'The miller of the Garden!' replied Guillot,
passionately.
</p>

<p>
And so it was; ere the Camisard outposts had been
able to give the alarm, they were cut to pieces, and
only Cavalier and a few of his men were able to sally
from the tower before it was invested on all sides.
Guillot and others were shut up in it!  Furious were
the efforts made by Cavalier&mdash;efforts urged by filial
love and despair&mdash;to drive back the soldiers and
relieve those in the tower, from the windows and
every cranny of which its slender garrison poured a
deadly fire for eight hours, till their ammunition was
expended, and then the edifice was set on fire; 290
perished in it, says history, 100 Camisards lay dead
outside, and around it were 1,200 of the King's troops
killed or wounded!
</p>

<p>
Compelled to retire some distance, yet fighting every
inch of the way, Cavalier beheld, with horror, the
tower sheeted with fire.  His soul died within him as
he thought of his brother, the boyish and gentle
Guillot, and all who were perishing there, and he strove
to fight his way back just as day was breaking, and
by the light of it he could see, apart from all the
hurly-burly of the strife, a remarkable combat proceeding,
and on the very verge of a cliff close by.
</p>

<p>
It was a boy&mdash;a boy, sword in hand&mdash;Guillot, fighting
with a young officer of the Regiment of Champagne.
His cap was off&mdash;his white camisa was stained by
blood and dirt and scorched with fire.  Borne back by
bayonets, Cavalier could only look on in agony, as he
saw his brother driven step by step to the very verge
of the dreadful cliff behind him, and of which he was
unaware.  Unyielding, though retreating, Guillot kept
parrying thrusts and warding cuts with consummate
skill, till a cry escaped him, and he vanished!
</p>

<p>
A groan from the breast of Cavalier echoed that
cry; a mist came over his sight, yet he continued to
fight, like a blind man, to cover the retreat of the
wreck of his followers, by whom wild justice was soon
after done on the treacherous miller.  He was seized,
condemned to death, and led out to execution in front
of the insurgents, who, according to their wont, knelt
around him, while offering up prayers for his soul.
His parting embrace was refused by his two sons, who
served under Cavalier, and who looked on unmoved
by the terrible death he had to die.
</p>

<p>
That his brother Guillot might perish in battle, or
by torture in the hands of the enemy, Cavalier had
always dreaded; but the catastrophe by which he lost
him was altogether unconceived: and the fortunes of
the conflict led him far from the vicinity of La Tour
de Bellot, thus he could neither search for the remains
of Guillot, nor bestow funeral rites upon them.
</p>

<p>
For months the war went on.  The bright valour
and cool judgment of Cavalier, 'the Boy-General,' for
such he was, exalted him still more above all other
leaders of the Camisards, and especially so when he
succeeded in utterly defeating a considerable body of
the royal troops at Martinarque, under the Sieur de
Montrevel, who commanded them.
</p>

<p>
The 6th of April, 1704, saw Cavalier again betrayed
by one he trusted.  At the head of 900 foot and 300
horse, all well equipped, he entered the Vaunage, or
Valley of Noyes, so called from a little town of that
name, in the fertile district westward of Nismes,
intending to waylay the Marechal de Montrevel, who
was on the way to Montpellier, but was himself lured
into a dreadful ambuscade, and surrounded on all
sides by the royal troops, including a great body of
King James's-Irish, who had recently fought at the
battle of the Boyne.
</p>

<p>
On all sides burst forth from amid the shelter of
trees and hedgerows the withering fire of musketry,
the boom of the cannon, and the hissing showers of
grape.
</p>

<p>
Undismayed by the sudden scene of carnage, and
by numbers six times exceeding his own, Cavalier,
perceiving a design of the enemy to completely cut
him off, 'wheeled his column rapidly round under the
hottest fire, and in the face of a charge of bayonets
drew off his men, retreating in echelon&mdash;a masterly
manœuvre of the baker's boy, which drew forth the
admiration of the Marechal Duc de Villars.'
</p>

<p>
Eventually, however, his retreat was cut off, the
royal troops occupied every height, every avenue and
pass that remained, and nothing was left for him now
but to cut his way out at all hazards, or die!  He was
not long in choosing.  'Throwing aside his magnificent
uniform and white plume, he put on a common dress,'
we are told, and ordering his comrades to close their
ranks, made a headlong dash at the enemy.
</p>

<p>
'Notre Dame de frappe morte!' was the shout of
the regiments of Champagne and Normandy, as they
brought their bayonets to the charge; but Cavalier
broke through the first line.  In the attack on the
second, he was singled out when discovered, and a
soldier seized the bridle of his horse, but had his hand
hewn off by a young Camisard wearing a scarlet scarf
over his white camisa.  He was next grasped by a
dragoon, whom he pistolled; but now, beyond
appeared another line and a whole squadron of dragoons
barring his way to the Pont de Rosni&mdash;the only issue.
Panic-struck, his fugitive horsemen poured madly
down upon it sword in hand, forgetful for a time of
their leader, who was in the rear, and who would
probably have been cut off but for the young Camisard
in the red scarf&mdash;his brother&mdash;his brother Guillot (of
whose escape anon), who suddenly appeared upon the
ground&mdash;'his brother, a boy <i>ten</i> (?) years old,' says the
French account, 'who drew his horse across the
bridge, and with a pistol presented to the fugitives,
summoned them to defend their chief and not abandon
him.'
</p>

<p>
Cavalier, with the remainder of his force, escaped
into the forest of Cannes.  This battle extended over
all the ground from the mill of Langlode to the town
of Noyes.  Of one thousand dead who lay on the field,
one half were Camisards.  During the whole of the
conflict one of their prophets, named Daniel Gui, stood
on the summit of a rock, amid six female enthusiasts,
three of whom were afterwards shot, invoking the God
of Battles to favour their cause.
</p>

<p>
The miraculous restoration of his brother&mdash;for such
it was deemed&mdash;alone was a palliation to the heart of
Cavalier for the deep mortification of his defeat; and
yet it had come about simply enough.  Recent rains
had formed a deep basin of water under the cliff from
which he fell, in a place where jagged rocks alone had
been visible shortly before.  Sinking, he rose to the
surface, struggled to the bank, faint and wounded,
and had found shelter, till well and whole, in a shepherd's
hut, till he could join his brother in the Valley
of the Noyes, and now tender indeed was their
meeting and the mutual embrace they gave each
other.
</p>

<p>
But brief time had they for mutual explanations, as
ere long the report of musketry began to wake the
echoes of the forest, and Daniel Gui came rushing in
with tidings that the Sieur de Lalande was putting to
the sword the entire inhabitants of the village of
Euzet.  Entering it suddenly, he had found a bullock
newly-skinned, and bales of hams, bread, and sausages
made up for the men of Cavalier, whom he at once
traced and attacked with vigour, and defeated with the
loss of 170 men.  Final vengeance now fell on the
unhappy villagers of Euzet, which, together with a
cavern close by, was found to be full of the wounded,
ammunition, medicine, and stores of Cavalier's forces.
This sealed the fate of the former; and every human
being lying there was slaughtered, including the
helpless creatures in the cavern.  Such was the awful
system on which this war was carried on.
</p>

<p>
Cavalier's commissariat was supplied by requisitions
upon districts, irrespective of their faith, and when not
given with goodwill, he was compelled to write thus
to the chief magistrate of the place:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'MM.,&mdash;Vous ne manquerez point de nous préparer
demain le diner, son peine d'être assiégé et mis <i>à feu
et à sang</i>!&mdash;CAVALIER.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But it was while he was still struggling manfully
and bravely to maintain a desperate cause against the
whole force of the French army that the crushing
intelligence came to him of the fall of his compatriot,
Roland Laporte.  This was on the 13th of August,
1704, at Castelnau, near the Ners, a river which in
winter rolls down from the mountains in a mighty
flood.
</p>

<p>
His presence there would seem to have been betrayed
to the Duc de Villars.  At midnight, when he and his
companions were fast asleep, the sentinel on the tower-head
suddenly heard amid the stillness of the hour the
distant noise of horses approaching at a furious gallop,
and gave the alarm just as a column of cavalry was
entering the town.
</p>

<p>
Half-clad and half-armed, the Camisards rushed to
the stables, and mounting their horses bare-backed,
rode off without saddles, bits, or spurs; thus they were
soon after taken in a deep hollow way, and compelled
to halt and dismount.  Planting his back against an
aged olive tree, Roland made a desperate resistance,
to every summons of 'Rendez vous! bas les armes
coquin!' replying by a blow of his sword, or shots
from his pistols, a row of which he carried in his girdle.
He slew several dragoons, ere one by a musket-shot
brought him down, by a mortal wound, on which his
comrades threw themselves above his body, and were
seized and bound.
</p>

<p>
On the 16th of August his body was dragged at the
tail of a cart into Nismes and burnt, while five of his
companions were broken alive on the wheel around his
funeral pyre.  Many Camisards perished thus here,
the most memorable executions being those of Catenat
and Ravenel, who were burned alive, almost within
sight of the battle-field on which they had defeated
the Comte de Broglie.
</p>

<p>
Jean Cavalier found himself almost alone now, yet
his spirit did not quail.
</p>

<p>
Marshal Villars had now come to the conclusion
that the warfare seemed likely to become interminable;
that it was possible to harass the hardy mountaineers
of the Cevennes, but not to conquer them.  So resolute
was the spirit of the Camisards, so impregnable their
hilly fortresses, that all hope of ending the war so long
as one was left alive, was relinquished by this able
officer; and we are told that in the heart of Cavalier,
who beheld the sufferings of the peasantry from
incessant toil and famine, there rose a great longing for
peace, if it were possible with safety and honour; and
on ascertaining that 10,000 of the Huguenots were
ready to lay down their arms and submit to the king,
he consented to hold an amicable parley with any
officer the latter might send.
</p>

<p>
Cavalier's first interview was with Lalande, who was
sent by Marshal Villars.  'Lalande surveyed the worn
garments and pale cheeks of the young hero, whose
deeds had reached the ears and troubled the mind of
Louis XIV., in the midst of his mighty foreign wars;
he looked upon the bodyguard of the rebel chief, and
saw there, too, signs of poverty and extreme physical
suffering, and believed that he knew how to treat with
men in such a condition.'
</p>

<p>
He proffered a large sum in gold, not a coin of
which Cavalier would touch, though he allowed his
followers to accept it for their starving wives and
children; and he made preliminary arrangements with
Lalande for a final interview with the Marechal Duc
de Villars.
</p>

<p>
It was in the summer of 1704 that the latter, the
renowned antagonist of Marlborough, entered the
garden of the Recollets, at St. Cesaire, near Nismes,
the site of which is now occupied by a theatre, to
discuss peace and war with 'the Boy-General,' Jean
Cavalier, who, resolved to produce all the effect he
could, appeared on this occasion magnificently
mounted, with a richly-laced coat, and a hat plumed
with white feathers.  Cavalier's young face looked
sad, we are told, and the tone of his voice was
melancholy, 'and Villars looked on him with a deep
admiration and sympathy.'
</p>

<p>
On this occasion Cavalier's bodyguard was a mounted
force of Camisards in white tunics.
</p>

<p>
The result of this memorable conference was, that
the insurgents laid down their arms on the assurances
of justice and tolerance in religion to the persecuted
Protestants of the Cevennes, and flattering promises
of reward and rank in the army of France to Jean
Cavalier; but neither one nor the other was destined
to be kept or fulfilled, and the Place de Boucarini, at
Nismes, was soon deluged with the blood of all who
fell into the hands of the Government.  The
Camisards now repudiated the treaty made by Cavalier,
and, finding himself reviled by many of these on the
one hand, and neglected by the Court on the other he
became an exile, and entered the army of Queen Anne
at the head of a regiment entirely formed of Huguenots.
</p>

<p>
As a colonel, in his twentieth year, he fought in the
British Army in Spain at the Battle of Almanza, under
the Earl of Peterborough, and there, in the defeat, his
battalion of Camisards was almost cut to pieces by the
victorious French, and there young Guillot, its major,
died sword in hand.
</p>

<p>
Of the after life of Cavalier we can trace little.  It
is only known that by the British Government he was
made Governor of the Isle of Jersey, and died at
Chelsea in the May of 1740.
</p>

<p>
It has been more than once asserted that he died <i>in</i>
the Hospital a pensioner, which is a mistake the
records there distinctly prove.
</p>

<p>
In the year before his death, on the 2nd of July, he
and his countryman, Colonel Balthazar Rivas de
Foisac, were appointed Major-Generals in the British
Army.

<h3>
THE BUGLE-BOY OF BADAJOZ.
</h3>

<p>
'Mother! mother! come out of the cold ground;
come to your little José, who is so lonely now!' wailed
a boy stretched on his mother's grave, while wetting
with his tears the flowers that had been laid there, and
the green turf, into which he dug his little hands in the
wildness of his great grief.
</p>

<p>
It was in the cemetery of the Penha Convent at
Cintra, and when ravaged Portugal lay wasted and
bleeding under the feet of the French army, led by
Marshal Junot, the Duc d'Abrantes, to Lisbon, in
1808, a period that seems long ago now, yet was fresh
enough in the memory of our fathers.
</p>

<p>
It was on a glorious evening in autumn, and the hill
of Cintra, the base of which is clothed with wood, but
which terminates in loose crags and splintered
pinnacles, was bathed in warm light, while every fissure
was covered with amaryllis and aglow with crimson
geranium, and giant evergreen oaks and cork-trees
were intertwined with vines, all adding to the beauty
of the scene.
</p>

<p>
On one hand towered up the hill with the Penha
Convent, on the other were the ruins of a Moorish
castle; but the sunshine and the scenery were lost on
the orphan boy.  He saw only his mother's grave,
and all the rest of the world seemed dark to him
indeed.
</p>

<p>
'Look up, my boy,' said a voice, as a hand was
kindly laid on his neck, and, rising from the turf, he
found himself face to face with an officer of Cazadores,
or Portuguese Light Infantry.  He was a handsome
and pleasant-looking man, clad in green uniform faced
with scarlet, and wearing silver epaulettes.  'Who
lies here that you weep for?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'My mother,' replied the boy, in a tone of infinite
tenderness.
</p>

<p>
'And your father?'
</p>

<p>
'Was De Castro, the guerilla chief, whom the French
shot at the gate of the Torre Vilha.  You have heard,
perhaps?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; he was taken prisoner in Lisbon; a brave
fellow&mdash;I knew him well,' replied the officer, with
kindling eyes and lowering brow.
</p>

<p>
'My mother never held up her head afterwards&mdash;and&mdash;and
three days ago she left me&mdash;and&mdash;and they
brought her here,' said the boy, with a fresh fit of
heavy weeping, as he pressed his knuckles into his
inflamed eyes.
</p>

<p>
In tatters, and dusky in complexion, yet rich in
colour, like the beggar-boys of Murillo's famous picture
in the Dulwich Gallery, he was a handsome little
fellow, with a clear olive skin, sparkling eyes of the
deepest hazel, and thick, wavy black hair.
</p>

<p>
'Have you no brother or sister?' asked the officer,
patting his uncovered head, for poor José was without
hat or cap.
</p>

<p>
'None now.  I had a sister once.'
</p>

<p>
'And she?'
</p>

<p>
'Was carried off by the French voltigeurs, and was
never seen again.  Poor Theresa!' said the boy, in a
gasping voice.
</p>

<p>
'And have you no home, my little fellow?'
</p>

<p>
'None, but the church porch.'
</p>

<p>
'Then come with me, and I will find you another.'
</p>

<p>
'Where, senhor?'
</p>

<p>
'Under the colours of His Majesty Pedro the Third.'
</p>

<p>
The boy's face lighted up.  It was too soon for
him to despair yet; he had youth and hope, 'youth,
with which the linen folds seem robes of purple, the
chaplet of cowslips becomes a monarch's crown,
and the wooden bench is as an ivory throne of empire.'
</p>

<p>
So little José Francisco de Castro, for such was his
name, gave his hand in confidence to Captain Dom
Pedro de Lobiera, and became a bugle-boy in the
Seventh Regiment of Cazadores, among the Portuguese
troops under the gallant Marshal Beresford,
and destined to co-operate more immediately with
that division of the British army which, led by
Lieutenant-General Sir John Hope, took possession
of Lisbon in 1808.
</p>

<p>
A curious combination of wrath and exultation
made José's heart beat tumultuously on the day he
first assumed his uniform, and he slung with a green
cord over his shoulder the bugle with which he was to
summon his comrades.
</p>

<p>
He had an admirable ear for music, and soon
mastered all the many bugle-calls requisite for the
manœuvres of light troops in the field, and by his
coolness and bravery, while yet in his teens, became
a prime favourite with his captain, with his colonel,
the Viscount de Sa (whose 'orderly bugler' he
became), and with the whole of the Seventh Cazadores
he became a species of regimental pet.
</p>

<p>
When the battle of Salamanca was won by
Wellington in the glorious summer of 1812, when we
attacked the Duc de Ragusa, and when Park's
Portuguese column was foiled in the first attempt to
storm the Arapiles, two steep, rugged, and solitary
hills that overlook the plain, it was José's bugle
sounding the 'rally' amid the hottest of the fire that
caused the southern hill to be re-won; and when
Marshal Beresford was unhorsed and wounded in the
leg, while charging at the head of the 11th Light
Dragoons, and again while leading a Portuguese
brigade, it was 'José de Castro, a bugle-boy of the
Seventh Cazadores,' that helped him to remount, as
the <i>Portuguiz Telegrafo</i> of that week records.
</p>

<p>
On the plains of Talavera de la Reyna, at the
heights of Busaco, and by the green hill of Albuera,
when the Anglo-Portuguese army fought Soult&mdash;that
memorable hill, by whose slope, at the close of the
terrible day, the men of our old 'Die Hards' of the
57th were seen lying in two distinct ranks, dead but
victorious&mdash;the Seventh Cazadores, when wavering
under the dreadful fire of the French infantry, and
menaced by the heavy cavalry of Latour-Maubourg,
were rallied in square by the bugle of José de Castro.
</p>

<p>
He was 'ever foremost in the path of danger,' says
the <i>Jornal de Commercio</i> of Lisbon; 'and the notes of
his bugle were heard in many of the desperate onsets
and bayonet charges of those well-fought fields.  In
all these actions he did his duty; but his name ought
ever to be remembered for a deed of valour, for which,
at the time, he gained well-merited applause, and
which was long afterwards passed from mouth to
mouth whenever the terrible siege of Badajoz was
mentioned.'
</p>

<p>
It is to the third siege of the city that the paper
refers.
</p>

<p>
'Give me your hand, José,' said the Viscount de Sa
on one occasion.  'What a boy you are!  You beat
the trumpeter who blew two trumpets at once at the
siege of Argos.'
</p>

<p>
As yet he seemed to have a charmed life; no ball
had ever touched him.  He was a good, devout, and
very grave boy, for, as Captain de Lobiera said, he
believed 'that the spirit of his dead mother
accompanied him wherever he went.'
</p>

<p>
It was on the 6th of March, 1812, that the army of
Wellington broke up from its cantonments, and, ten
days after, crossed the Guadiana, and three divisions,
under Beresford and Picton, at once invested Badajoz,
then garrisoned by five thousand men under Generals
Phillipon and Vaillant, whose tenacious resistance
caused some uneasiness to the British leader, as a
defeat under its walls might have seriously disarranged
all his plans for the future.
</p>

<p>
Before the Seventh Cazadores entered the trenches
they had halted a few miles from Badajoz, after a long
and harassing day's march.  The rain fell in torrents
that night.  Amid the misty gloom, in the distance,
the guns of the beleaguered city were seen to flash
redly out upon the night, and weird was the glare
of the port fires as they sputtered on the gusty
wind.
</p>

<p>
All that comfortless night, José, like the rest of his
comrades, spent the weary hours in the open air.  He
placed his canteen on the ground, put his knapsack
above it, and, thus improvising a seat, strove to sleep,
with his greatcoat and blanket spread over his shoulders
for warmth.  And when the chill gray dawn came, he
was so stiff that, at first, he could scarcely place the
cold mouth of the bugle to his lips.
</p>

<p>
'Now, my men&mdash;la générale!' cried the Viscount
de Sa, as he leaped on his horse, and the buglers, at
the head of whom stood little José de Castro, poured
clearly and melodiously on the morning wind, 'the
générale,' that old warning for the march&mdash;a warning
long since disused in the British service, where it was
well known once.
</p>

<p>
Then the Cazadores took the road for Badajoz, and
that night were there in the trenches.
</p>

<p>
It is recorded of José that before the Cazadores
marched that morning he and a comrade bugler, Diaz
of Belem, gave up the little pay they possessed to
repair the loss of a poor woman whose hen-roost had
been pillaged of its inmates in the night.
</p>

<p>
The early weeks of 1812 were cold and rainy at
Badajoz, and the howling tempests of wind often
concealed at night the noise of the shovels and pickaxes,
as the troops broke ground, within a hundred and
sixty yards of Fort Picurina, and pushed forward the
trenches, till they achieved an opening four thousand
feet long&mdash;a work of five days' duration, under a
dreadful shower of shot and shell.
</p>

<p>
Our artillery had succeeded in making a practicable
breach, by which the columns of assault might enter
whenever the order to advance was given; but the
position of the enemy was strong by nature, and made
more so by art.  Enormous beams of timber, loaded
shell, huge stones, hand grenades, cold shot, all to be
launched from the hand, with relays of ready-loaded
muskets, were there, for those who were to keep the
breaches; in these, too, were hundreds of live bombs
and sunken powder-barrels, ready to blow an assaulting
force to pieces; and it became evident that the
chances of that force proving successful were small,
unless some of the unforeseen accidents of war turned
the tide in their favour.
</p>

<p>
This point, say the Portuguese, it was the good
fortune of José de Castro to achieve.  For the actual
truth of the episode which won him the name of
'The Bugle Boy of Badajoz,' we do not vouch.
There is not a word of it in Napier, or in the
despatches of the Duke of Wellington; but yet it was
universally believed in the army of Marshal Beresford.
</p>

<p>
It is related in history that when the final, and, to so
many, fatal, night of the 6th of April came&mdash;that
awful night of horror and of triumph when Badajoz
was won&mdash;when more than two thousand of our
officers and men perished in the breaches alone, and
when the heart of the 'Iron Duke' gave way to a
passionate burst of grief for the slaughter of his gallant
soldiers&mdash;on that night, we say, the 'unforeseen
accident,' recorded by history, was a feint attack
unexpectedly becoming a real one; but the Portuguese
have it that José de Castro, being of an inquiring turn
of mind, and having, during his service, had many
opportunities of hearing the French bugle-calls, had
learned them all to perfection, and now resolved to
turn his knowledge thereof to good account.
</p>

<p>
After a lighted carcase, composed of the direst
combustibles, and of giant size, had been flung blazing
from the walls by the French, compelling the assault
to be anticipated by half-an-hour, when the stormers
neared the great breach, José and his comrade,
Diaz of Belem, advanced with the rest of the Cazadores.
</p>

<p>
When Diaz was in the act of taking some brandy
from his canteen, a sixteen-pound shot took off his
head.  Yet, bugle in hand, José kept on, resolved to
put in practice the scheme he had formed, and with
which he had acquainted his colonel, the Viscount de
Sa, and his captain, De Lobiera.
</p>

<p>
As leaves are swept before a tempest, the stormers
came sweeping up the rough <i>débris</i> of the breach
covered with dead and wounded men, encumbered by
these at every step, shells bursting, shot and grenades
falling among them.  Their shouts were terrible; the
yells of the French more terrible still!  Up, up they
went, till they found the perilous gap was crossed by
a glittering, dreadful, and impassable <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>,
composed of sword-blades, keenly edged and sharply
pointed, fixed in ponderous beams, chained together,
and strongly wedged in the shot-riven ruins.  Beyond
it were masses of the French pouring in their deadly
fire, sweeping the gap with sheets of lead as the wind
sweeps a tunnel.
</p>

<p>
Under the <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> the gallant José
contrived to creep unseen, and, getting beyond it, to
conceal himself among a heap of dead.  On again
crept, his dark blue uniform, splashed with blood
clay, enabling him to pass unnoticed among the
French, till he reached an angle of the ramparts.
</p>

<p>
Then he put his bugle to his lips and blew loudly
and clearly, again and again, above the awful din of
the assault, the French <i>recall</i>!
</p>

<p>
On this the French gave way, fell back, and eventually
fled across the river into Fort San Christoval,
where, next day, they surrendered as prisoners of war
to Lord Fitzroy Somerset, the future Lord Raglan of
Crimean fame.
</p>

<p>
The action of José de Castro, say the Portuguese,
was noised about, after the surrender of Badajoz, until
it reached the ears of the Commander-in-Chief&mdash;the
great Duke&mdash;who sent for him, and presented him
with a sum equal to a hundred guineas English,
which, in consequence of his youth, Captain Pedro de
Lobiera was to pay him in small instalments.  It is
also said that the Duke gave the money from his
own private purse.  José also received a good
service medal, and the Portuguese decoration No. 3.
</p>

<p>
He was now only eighteen, and the honours he
received might have turned an older head; but he
continued to be as grave, modest, and well-dispositioned
as, when a boy, Captain de Lobiera found him
beside his mother's grave in the cemetery of the
Penha Convent at Cintra; and while many were
promoted to commissions, he followed the fortunes of
the Peninsular army with his bugle slung at his
back.
</p>

<p>
That bugle was heard on the plains of Vittoria, and
among the passes of the Pyrenees, where De Castro
was wounded and conveyed to the town of Elizondo.
There, while stretched on a pallet of straw, in the
vestibule of a convent, which had been turned into a
military hospital, he was attended and nursed by a
lay sister, who turned out to be his sister Theresa,
who had been carried off by the French, but had
achieved her escape after their defeat and total rout
at Vittoria.
</p>

<p>
It would be difficult to describe the mingled joy
and grief of such a meeting; but both were of brief
duration.  As soon as José was reported fit for duty,
he rejoined the Seventh Cazadores, with whom he
served at Nivelle, Orthes, and Bordeaux.
</p>

<p>
His bugle was heard for the last time in battle near
the hill of Toulouse, when he sounded the charge by
the order of the Viscount de Sa.  In that advance
the latter fell wounded from his horse, and, seeing
that Captain de Lobiera, the next senior officer, was
defenceless, his sword-blade having been broken off
near the hilt by a ball, he gave him his own,
saying:
</p>

<p>
'Lead on, De Lobiera! forward, the Cazadores!  I
can do no more to-day.'
</p>

<p>
And once again the bugle of José sounded the
command to charge.
</p>

<p>
When the army was disbanded at the peace, José
endeavoured to support himself by teaching music,
but in a way so humble that he led a life of privation
and penury, and sought, in vain, a pension from the
Portuguese Government.
</p>

<p>
It was at the little town of Golega, on the Tagus,
in Portuguese Estramadura, that we last heard of 'the
Bugler of Badajoz.'  This was more than twenty years
ago, and he was earning a precarious livelihood by
teaching the cornet.
</p>

<p>
He was then an old man, bent with years and
infirmity, and had for the last time renewed his prayer
for a pension to the Portuguese Government.  'Let
us charitably hope it will be granted,' said a writer in
the Lisbon <i>Jornal de Commercio</i> of that year, 'for
there is now in the Ministry a soldier who has not
forgotten the part he bore himself in the bloody
episodes of the Peninsular War, one who has left an
arm on a gory battlefield, and whose hearing has been
destroyed by the thunder of artillery&mdash;the noble and
valiant Viscount de Sa (the son of his old colonel).
This gallant soldier will yet have ears for the petition
of the poor <i>trombadero</i>, and be able to award him the
meed he merits.'

<h3>
THE VOYAGE OF THE 'BON ACCORD.'
</h3>

<p>
My name is Bob Slingsby, and in the autumn of last
year I was senior apprentice, or midshipman (for we
wore a smart uniform), on board the good ship <i>Bon
Accord</i> of Aberdeen, freighted from London to Hong
Kong, and a few who may survive to read these lines
will recall the story I am about to tell&mdash;the plain
unvarnished one of a sailor boy (I was then only sixteen)
in the Indian seas.
</p>

<p>
We had left Swatow on the 24th of September,
after getting on board a pilot, who was the cause of
all the mischief that followed.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Bon Accord</i> was a fine full-rigged clipper ship,
of Aberdeen build, 900 tons, coppered to the bends,
with masts that raked well aft; she was straight as
an arrow in her planksheer, and was well armed, for
there are some ugly customers to be met with in these
seas beyond the ordinary track of our cruisers, as we
found to our cost.
</p>

<p>
The ship's company consisted of Captain Archibald,
a good and resolute seaman, who hailed from the port
of Leith; three mates, the doctor, Joe Ruddersford,
boatswain, two apprentices (myself and my chum,
little Charlie Newcome, for we were three short
according to our tonnage), and thirty men&mdash;thirty-eight
all told, and a few lubberly Lascars who all
bolted when the first sign of danger came.
</p>

<p>
We had been well warned on nearing Hong Kong
to keep a bright look-out for Macao piratical boats,
and particularly for one large lorcha manned by only
such desperadoes as are to be found about these
shores; and the captain of which, we were informed&mdash;Long
Kiang by name&mdash;was as great a ruffian as ever
figured of old, when Hong Kong was named by the
Spaniards the Island of Ladrones, or thieves.
</p>

<p>
In a copy of the <i>China Mail</i> brought on board at
Aden, we read a description of Long Kiang, which
told us that he had been pierced and scarred by many
wounds; that one of his eyes had been scorched out
by gunpowder, and that his left arm, having been
severely shattered by a shot from a swivel gun, had
never been properly set, the fragments had worked
themselves out, and this gave him the singular
appearance of having an arm and elbow adhering to the
shoulder by the flesh and tendons alone; yet this arm
possessed double the strength of his right, and it was
his boast that he had slain more men by it than with
the other.
</p>

<p>
We made the name of Long Kiang a kind of joke&mdash;a
bogie&mdash;on board during the voyage through the bay
of Bengal and into the China seas, and had nearly
forgotten all about him, when without other adventure
than a foul wind or so we reached Swatow, some fifty
miles distant from Hong Kong, and after anchoring
for a little time, left it, as I have said, on the 24th of
September, with a light fair wind, and by sunset had
made an offing.
</p>

<p>
As evening deepened upon the crimson sea, the wind
became lighter; then it fell calm, and the fore and
main courses were hauled up, while the top-sails were
left to flap idly against the masts; and now it was
that a native boat came alongside with a pilot, who
offered to take us to our destination for a certain sum
in British money, and his services were accepted by
Captain Archibald, to whom he showed, of course,
good and well-attested certificates.
</p>

<p>
No trousers covered the long, lean, mahogany-coloured
legs of this official; an ample abba was rolled
round his body, and a tattered keffiah, of no particular
hue, thrown loosely round his head, partly muffled his
face, so that we could see but little of his features.
</p>

<p>
The wind freshened after a time; we let fall the
courses and stretched them home, glad to make way
on the ship; which had been drifting with a current.
</p>

<p>
Instead of standing by the binnacle and giving
instructions to a steersman, the native pilot grasped
the wheel unaided in his powerful hands, and from
time to time it seemed to me that he cast his eyes
oftener to the shore than aloft to keep the canvas
full.  As he stood there between us and the moonlight,
his tall and muscular form and fantastic dress,
when viewed in dark outline, had something weird
and mysterious about them, and so thought Charlie
Newcome, who was watching him narrowly, as we
stood on the starboard side of the quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
The mate of the watch was forward, looking after
the 'ground tackle' and large anchor, and the captain
was below, when suddenly Charlie, on whom the tall,
stark figure of the stranger seemed to make an
impression, twitched my sleeve and whispered:
</p>

<p>
'Look, Bob! look now!  By Jove! isn't he
like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Like who?'
</p>

<p>
'Long Kiang, that we talked so much about&mdash;the
fellow described in the <i>China Mail</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'You've got Long Kiang on the brain,' said I,
laughing; but the laughter ceased when I <i>did</i> look.
</p>

<p>
The light breeze had partly deranged the Arab-like
keffiah that enveloped his head, and by the rays of the
binnacle lamp we saw that he was minus the left
eye, that the whole of that side of his face was
distorted as if scorched by powder, and for a moment
or two the strange malformation of his left arm was
distinctly visible, as he gasped one of the under-spokes
of the wheel.
</p>

<p>
'It cannot be,' said I.  'How about his certificates,
Charlie?'
</p>

<p>
'Another man's papers&mdash;stolen, no doubt.'
</p>

<p>
'If he should, after all, be Long Kiang,' I began,
and then paused, for as I spoke the name seemed to
catch his ear, and he turned on me his solitary eye,
which in the moonlight glistened redly, like that of a
rattlesnake.  A knife of portentous length was in the
same sheath with his chopsticks, a knife suggestive of
cutting other things than yams or salt junk.
</p>

<p>
'Won't you youngsters turn in?' said the mate,
coming aft.  'You are both in the middle watch.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, sir; not just yet,' said I, for, truth to
tell, we were disposed to be wide awake as weasels.
</p>

<p>
Long Kiang had been such a standing joke during
the latter part of our voyage&mdash;at least after leaving
Aden&mdash;that neither of us, whatever we thought, ventured
to tell our fears or suspicions to the mate, or to
the men forward.  While we were talking to the mate,
the captain, who had come on deck, called him to the
port side of the ship, which was going before the wind,
but very slowly.
</p>

<p>
The captain was a tall, stout, and well-built man,
with a florid complexion and a mass of iron-grey
hair, luxuriant as when in youth, and likely to be so
for years to come.  There was an air of sturdy Scotch
power and strength of mind and body about him
that showed at once his resolute will and energetic
brain.
</p>

<p>
He and the mate of the watch were in close conference
at the port quarter, and looking at some object
with an interest that soon became anxiety after they
had resorted to the use of a night-glass, on seeing
which the tall pilot grinned and showed all his white
teeth like a row of dominoes.
</p>

<p>
'It is a lorcha&mdash;full of men, and evidently dodging
us&mdash;a Macao lorcha, too,' said the captain, in a low
voice.  'You see that craft?' he said suddenly to the
pilot, who had evidently for some time affected not to
do so.
</p>

<p>
'Si&mdash;si&mdash;yaas&mdash;senhor,' he replied in the broken
lingo peculiar to Macao.
</p>

<p>
'And what do you think of her?'
</p>

<p>
'That piecey boat makey fightey if you meddle with
her,' he replied quietly, in what is called 'pigeon
English' in these regions.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, she will, will she?' exclaimed the captain;
'bring the starboard tacks aft.  Keep the ship away
a few points.'
</p>

<p>
But the breeze was so light that the lorcha was able
to pass and repass us with ease, on each tack coming
nearer us, and, indeed, it became but too evident that
the steersman handled the ship in such a way that in
a short time the stranger would be quite able to
overhaul us.  She was already within half-a-mile of us
when Captain Archibald roughly accused the pilot of
treachery, and ordered the third mate to take the
wheel.  Ere he could do so the native uttered a shout,
quitted the spokes, letting them revolve at will,
throwing the ship in the wind, and then he leaped
overboard.
</p>

<p>
An exclamation burst from all, for had the breeze
been fresher the top-mast would have snapped off at
the caps and left us a helpless wreck; but the
captain&mdash;quick, ready, and powerful&mdash;caught the wheel in a
moment, brought the ship again upon a wind, and
without looking whether the traitor who had left us
sank or swam, ordered the ship to be close hauled, as
she was clipper-built, and to be steered 'full
and by.'
</p>

<p>
Some of the watch said the lorcha had picked up our
pilot.  Charlie and I now spoke, and not a doubt
remained in the minds of all that we had been
deceived by Long Kiang, who, using the papers of some
man he had robbed, and very probably destroyed, had
steered the ship to a part of the coast of Swatow,
where his vessel and men had been concealed in some
bay or creek.
</p>

<p>
By nine p.m. the lorcha, which we knew must be
manned by the ferocious half-breeds who are the
sons of Chinese and Tartar slaves, with a mixture of
Caffre and Portuguese, the refuse of Macao, was so
close, that in the moonlight we could see them
distinctly, and reckoned that she must have at least
seventy of these on board, and all armed to the
teeth!
</p>

<p>
Charlie and I had read much about pirates and wild
adventures, and had longed to meet some; and now
the time had come with a vengeance!
</p>

<p>
The Scottish firm to whom the <i>Bon Accord</i> belonged
had wisely armed her well.
</p>

<p>
'Now, my lads,' cried Captain Archibald, as all the
small arms were brought on deck, and the crew
mustered aft the mizenmast, 'obey me; act well and
steadily; have faith in yourselves, for without it no
man succeeds.'
</p>

<p>
A cheer responded, and under the care of the old
boatswain, who had sailed with Archibald for more
than twenty years, the guns were cast loose and
loaded, and as some of our fellows belonged to the
Royal Naval Reserve, they were at no loss how to go
to work.
</p>

<p>
In common with several others, Charlie and I had
revolvers; but somehow, as I loaded mine, my heart
was beating wildly, and, like Charlie Newcome, I
thought of my mother, far away in Kent, as I had
never thought of her before!
</p>

<p>
If captured, we knew that every soul on board would
perish by a miserable death.  Of a peaceful escape
we had no chance, as the wind was so light, and
many a glance was cast aloft to see how the sails
drew.
</p>

<p>
The lorcha was stealing steadily after us in our
wake now, for doubtless Long Kiang had told his
crew of our guns, and knew that while she was
kept astern they would be useless.  Already the
pirates were so close that we could hear their voices,
and see knives, bayonets, and tulwars glittering among
them, and towering amid the throng the tall and
muscular figure of the ferocious Long Kiang, so we
could have no doubt of the intentions of his followers
now.
</p>

<p>
'She will soon be under our counter, sir,' said the
old boatswain, 'and, as we have little or no steerage
way on the ship, our eight-pounders will soon be
useless.'
</p>

<p>
'Then let fly the starboard gun, and bring her to on
the wind.'
</p>

<p>
Bang went the gun, its white smoke curling over
the moonlighted water.  A yell rose from the lorcha,
and a red, flashing, and spluttering fire of musketry
responded.  No one was hit as yet, but white splinters
were knocked off the woodwork on deck.
</p>

<p>
'Fill the yard heads!  Stand off; Re-load, and
then bring to again!'  This manœuvre was repeated
more than once.
</p>

<p>
Bang! bang! went the six-pounders from the port
quarter.  The yells were redoubled, and as every man
who was not at the guns was busy with his breach-loading
rifle, the work soon became hot indeed.  While
lying close to the gunwale, Charlie and I fired at
random with our revolvers under the open leeboard; yet
the whole situation was so strangely sudden&mdash;so
unexpected and improbable&mdash;that it seemed as if all this
peril was happening not to me&mdash;Bob Slingsby&mdash;but
to someone else.
</p>

<p>
Close by us was the captain, busy with his Winchester
repeating rifle.
</p>

<p>
The yells of the infuriated pirates, maddened by the
slaughter we made among them, became every moment
closer and more appalling, and united with the sound
of the firing, made such a din that we could not hear
ourselves speak.
</p>

<p>
In the foretopmast of the lorcha they were now
getting their horrible stink-balls ready, while, by the
use of sweeps, they came close under our stern, and
we could see their fierce, dark visages, their glowing
eyes, and white glistening teeth.  These stink-balls
are an odious composition of mealed powder, saltpetre,
pitch, and sulphur, rasped hoofs burned in the fire,
assafœtida, and all manner of foul-smelling herbs, and
they threw them, smoking and flaming, on the quarterdeck
by dozens, compelling us to retire forward, if we
would escape suffocation.
</p>

<p>
Several of our men had now fallen, killed or
wounded, and the crew of the lorcha came swarming
up the mizen chains, over the quarter, and rushed on
madly with swords, knives, and fixed bayonets; and
then it was the Lascars vanished by running below,
or leaping overboard.
</p>

<p>
In vain our stoutest seamen strove to stem the tide
by bayonet and rifle, and the scene became to me
agonising and terrific.  The whole deck became
slippery with blood.
</p>

<p>
Captain Archibald, bleeding from a wound, was shot
again in the forerigging.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my wife and bairns!' he cried, and fell dead
on the deck.  The chief mate fell next: another and
another fell, and I found myself seeking shelter from
the bullets near the forecastle bitts.
</p>

<p>
Who had fallen or who escaped I knew not, but the
crew of the lorcha were now in full possession of the
<i>Bon Accord</i>.  Two or three dark faces appeared above
the topgallant forecastle.  Shots were fired at me, and
with a prayer on my lips I fell into the sea, and then
thought all was over with me.  Mechanically I swam,
and the miscreants kept firing at me and some Lascars
who were in the water.
</p>

<p>
An oar belonging to the lorcha was floating near
me.  I grasped it, and got close to the forechains.  All
voices on deck, save those of the captors, had ceased.
The firing was at an end.  A few dead bodies, thrown
overboard, plunged heavily into the water near me,
and raised great phosphorescent circles and bubbles
of water in the gorgeous moonlight.  The breeze had
freshened a little; the reef points had ceased to patter
upon the white sails which now curved gracefully out,
and as the ship began to make a little way upon the
water, I grasped the iron work under the forechains,
and was carried with her.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a rope's-end was lowered within my reach,
and I heard a voice saying, in pigeon English:
</p>

<p>
'Comey up&mdash;me no killy you.'
</p>

<p>
I looked upward, and saw the terrible face of Long
Kiang, with an indescribable gleam in his solitary eye,
as it regarded me.  Aware that it was either for life or
death, and that I might as well trust him as perish by
a bullet or of drowning by exhaustion, I allowed myself
to be drawn on board, and one of the first sights I
saw was the body of poor little Charlie Newcome,
lying near one of the maindeck guns.  Many dead
and wounded pirates lay about.
</p>

<p>
On deck, I found myself the only living white!
</p>

<p>
Long Kiang grasped me by the arm with one
hand, a long knife glittered in the other, and in a
mixture of broken Portuguese and pigeon English,
which would seem ridiculous to read, but was very
terrible for me to hear, he questioned me about the
ship; where she was from, what was her cargo, and
where any money was stored.  Finding that I was
unable to give any account of the latter, Long Kiang,
whose fierce eye when he was excited seemed to emit
sparks as if struck from a flint&mdash;a peculiar
phenomenon&mdash;gave me a terrible blow with the hand of his
boneless arm, and, falling senseless, I remembered no
more.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Macao men completely sacked the
ship.  Rice, biscuit-bags, beef-barrels, the fowls in the
coops, wines, spirits, bedding, clothes, all loose ropes,
and everything portable were carried on board the
lorcha, and setting fire to the cabin, intending to
destroy all trace of the ship by burning her to the
water's edge, they finally shoved off to the lorcha, and
getting the spirit casks aboard, began, like savages as
they were&mdash;to make merry and have a night of it&mdash;and
a night they <i>had</i> of it, that they little anticipated!
</p>

<p>
About eleven p.m. I recovered, and found myself
alone in the silent ship.  The lorcha lay off about a
quarter of a mile distant, floating on the calm and lonely
moonlit sea, over which came the united noise of laughter,
singing, and shouts, as the orgies were continued in
her bunks below and on deck.  The odour of burning
wood drew me to the cabin, which I found full of smoke;
but on lifting the skylight, as well as the wound I
had received would permit me, I found where the fire
was smouldering, and after extinguishing it by a
bucket or two of water, began to look about me with
a heart torn by anxiety and apprehension.  Lamps,
chronometers, compasses, everything, were gone; but
had they remained, of what use would they have been
to me?
</p>

<p>
On the blood-stained deck, where still some bodies,
slashed and mutilated, were lying, their pallid visages
looking doubly pale under the moon, I crawled forward,
concealing myself under the bulwarks, to avoid
being seen by the occupants of the lorcha, which was
floating like a log upon the water.
</p>

<p>
In the forecastle bunks and elsewhere, to my intense
joy, I found seven of our own men, all more or less
wounded, coming forth now from their places of
concealment&mdash;the old boatswain among them&mdash;but all
doubtful what to do or how to act; for the slightest
sound or movement in the ship might bring these
wretches on board of her again; so we all cowered
together in the forecastle, considering the future, and
listening to the shouting and singing on board the
lorcha.  These seemed to grow fainter the nearer she
was drawn towards the <i>Bon Accord</i> by the current;
and some time after midnight they totally ceased, and
the deepest silence reigned upon the sea, for the
breeze had died completely away, and we heard only
the slow flapping of the topsails, and the pattering of
the reef-points above our heads.
</p>

<p>
Old Joe Rudderford, our boatswain, who was certain,
he said, 'that every man Jack of them was drunk as
a lord,' now resolved to take measures that would rid
us of them effectually ere day dawned; and, acting
under his orders, we put them in practice thus:
</p>

<p>
The port-quarter boat was softly lowered, on the
side that was not next the lorcha, and he, with two
men and myself, with oars muffled, pulled swiftly, yet
noiselessly, off to her.  All our revolvers were loaded,
and Joe, the boatswain, had with him the largest and
sharpest auger he could find in the carpenter's
tool-chest, and a fierce, triumphant expression shone on
his grave, grim Scotch face, which had a chin and
eyebrows that expressed resolution and firmness of
purpose.
</p>

<p>
Never shall I forget the keen and aching anxiety
and excitement of that time, as we crept towards the
hateful lorcha, and at every stroke of our oars, at
every respiration, expected to see some of her
merciless crew start up and fire on us; but all
remained still&mdash;still as death&mdash;on board, as we got
close under her starboard counter.
</p>

<p>
Our first mission was to cut away and scuttle her
only boat, and while the boatswain, with strong hands
and brawny arms wrenching round the cross-handle
of the augur, bored a succession of large round holes
between wind and water&mdash;with a few <i>below</i> the
latter&mdash;two of our men with knives cut away all the
starboard shrouds or stays; and as we left her, and
pulled away to our own ship, the sea was pouring
into her, and we knew that unless the artificial
leaks were discovered and plugged she must surely
go down.
</p>

<p>
'Thank heaven, the breeze is freshening!' exclaimed
Joe, as we regained our unfortunate ship, and
hoisted in the quarter boat; and, weak and faint as
we all were from wounds, soon Joe himself made sail
on her.  During all the hours of that eventful morning
we struggled to trim the ship, to coil up and clear
away the loose ropes and running rigging; to throw
overboard the dead men of the lorcha, which was now
settling down fast by the stern in the light of the
waning moon, and every moment her bow and
bowsprit seemed to tilt up higher in the air.
</p>

<p>
At last, just as day began to break, a great commotion
seemed suddenly to take place on board.  Cries
and shouts floated towards us on the freshening
breeze, and we could see Macaomen, Chinamen,
and Caffres rushing wildly to and fro, looking
evidently for their vanished boat; and then their united
yells rent the sky, as the lorcha gave a great lurch to
port and anon went down with every man on board
of her.  Many swam about for a time, but all sank
in succession, for the land was far distant, and we
were standing off north and by east before a pleasant
breeze.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we fell in with a native fishing-boat
with a crew of three men, who agreed, for the sum of
five British sovereigns, to pilot us into Hong Kong,
where we duly arrived, and came safely to anchor in
the famous 'Red Harbour,' after a voyage that none
of us are likely to forget.
</p>

<p>
We had some strange adventures on the way home,
and with these I shall close my story.
</p>

<p>
Of our crew, after the encounter with Long Kiang,
only seven, with the boatswain, Joe Rudderford, and
myself, remained with the ship.  We got a new
captain, and made up our number again to thirty-eight
hands, all told, from the company of a bark
that had been cast away in the East Lamma Channel,
and after they were shipped an interesting event
occurred.
</p>

<p>
Among them was a miserable-looking young fellow
who had been wrecked years before on the coast of
China, and been kept as a kind of slave in a village
near Tonquin.  Joe Rudderford, observing the assiduity
with which this young seaman&mdash;in gratitude for
finding himself once more under the Union Jack&mdash;did
his work, asked him what was his native place.
</p>

<p>
'Stonehaven,' said he; 'I am a Scotsman.'
</p>

<p>
'Stonehaven!  I am from there myself.  What is
your name?'
</p>

<p>
'William Rudderford.'
</p>

<p>
'Had you ever a brother?' asked the boatswain,
with sudden agitation.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied the other; 'but it is many a year
since he last saw me, in our mother's cottage beside
the Cowie water.  Poor Joe!  I wonder if he is alive
now!'
</p>

<p>
'I am Joe&mdash;your brother Joe, Willie!' exclaimed
the boatswain; and now for several minutes their
feelings so overpowered them that they could neither
of them speak till relief was given by tears; and each
had to tell the other a long story, which lies apart
from mine.
</p>

<p>
We left Hong Kong for New Zealand, with a mixed
cargo, and dropped down the Lamma Channel into
the China Sea, and after leaving the port for which
we were destined, gladly trimmed our course for
London, thinking by this time we had seen a good
deal of the world of waters; but after leaving the
harbour of Otago, and working to windward of a
headland named the Nuggets, we stood away for the
Southern Pacific.
</p>

<p>
From that time the people in Dunedin, which we
had left, and in London, for which we were bound,
heard of us no more.
</p>

<p>
No homeward-bound craft reported having seen or
spoken with the good ship <i>Bon Accord</i>, of Aberdeen;
no message concerning her came from the antipodes;
and, to torture the minds of our friends at home, the
newspapers circulated all kinds of rumours&mdash;that bits
of wreck had been seen, that we had among our cargo
thirty tons of gunpowder, together with 'no end'
of petroleum and turpentine, commodities certainly
calculated to produce the direst effects if ignited.
</p>

<p>
Month after month rolled on, and not even the most
slender tidings came of the beautiful ship, and
apprehension of a terrible fate deepened into certainty, in
the loving hearts of all who had friends on board.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, where were we?
</p>

<p>
In about the 50th degree of southern latitude we had
for weeks pleasant gales and prosperous weather, so
that we scarcely required to lift tack or sheet, but
bore on merrily.  Joe Rudderford and his newly-recovered
brother Willie were inseparable, and the
memory of little Charlie Newcome often came back
to me sadly, especially in the night-watches, which he
and I had so often shared together, for the ship and
her surroundings were all the same in many respects
as when he sailed in her.  But we had not been long
at sea before we discovered that our new captain was
a bad seaman and a bully.
</p>

<p>
Every order was given with an oath.  Myself and
the other apprentices he called 'young whelps,' and
even respectable old Joe Rudderford was often greeted
with taunts which he received in silence, remembering
'the least said, the soonest mended.'
</p>

<p>
'He is a coward,' said Joe to me one day.
</p>

<p>
'What makes you think so?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Because he is a tyrant, and tyrants are always
cowards.  We'll never have a captain again so good as
brave old Archibald.'
</p>

<p>
In that latitude a curious incident occurred to us.
On a fine morning, when running on a splendid
breeze, with our port tacks on board and royals and
top-gallants set, Willie Rudderford, who had the
watch, reported a sail on the weather-bow&mdash;a large
ship, full-rigged, with most of her canvas set, but all
in confusion, and some of it thrown slack.  Her
top-hamper suggested perfect disorder, and not a soul was
to be seen on board, or responded to our hailing, after
we edged close down to her.
</p>

<p>
We hove to, threw the mainyard in the wind, and
Joe Rudderford, the first mate, and two hands, of
whom I was one, boarded her in the dingy.
</p>

<p>
I shall never forget the nervous, anxious, exciting
and yet eerie emotions felt, as we clambered up the
side of that silent ship.
</p>

<p>
She proved to be a new one of some 800 tons
burden, laden with silk and indigo, to the value of
£150,000, as her papers showed, bound from Calcutta
to the Cape; but how she came to be in these southern
waters surpassed our comprehension.  The oddest
thing of all was that there seemed to have been a
panic on board, for the deck and cabins were strewed
with the clothes of ladies and children; jewel-cases,
jewels, and Indian shawls lay everywhere; but the
chief part of the baggage had been taken away.  Still
more extraordinary was it to find that she had been
scuttled in every compartment, evidently for the
purpose of sinking her.  Private letters, that we had
no time to examine, lay strewed about, and cloaks and
coats, bonnets and caps, yet hung on the hooks in the
cabin.  But what was her story, or the fate of those
who had abandoned her, or why they had done so, we
were fated never to know; for though our captain was
in the highest glee at picking up so valuable a derelict,
and proposed to put a few of the crew on board, and
sail in company, a heavy gale came on after sunset,
with thick clouds, and when day broke she was
nowhere to be seen, and must have gone down in the
night.
</p>

<p>
And now I come to the mystery of our disappearance.
</p>

<p>
Our voyage had been an exceedingly prosperous
one till we reached the vicinity of the Crozet Islands,
in the South Pacific.
</p>

<p>
This solitary group, 'placed far amid the melancholy
main,' comprising the Marion Rocks and the Twelve
Apostles, lies midway between Prince Edward's
Island and the Island of Kerguelen, the abode only
of seals and sea swallows, and twenty-two degrees west
of the equally solitary St. Paul's, whereon
H.M.S. <i>Megara</i> was cast away.
</p>

<p>
The Crozet Islands are all of volcanic origin&mdash;wild,
rugged, and horrid in aspect, and nearly inaccessible.
Their mountains rise in conical peaks to an elevation
of from four to five thousand feet, and are covered by
perpetual snow, while dense fogs frequently envelop
their bases.
</p>

<p>
Before we came to this dangerous vicinity we had
encountered a gale; but it had spent its fury, and was
subsiding.  The prospect, however, of the winter
evening sea (for though the month was July, it was
the season of midwinter there) was cheerless&mdash;a
darkening sky, and nothing living in view but a
seabird or two, swimming and skimming over the white
tops of the grey waves.
</p>

<p>
It had become evident to all on board that the
captain's work as navigator disagreed with that of
the mate and Joe Rudderford.  He was 'out of his
reckoning,' but was wroth with anyone who dared to
hint that he was so; and, to allay his chagrin, drank
large quantities of spirits.
</p>

<p>
With night dense fogs came down upon the sea;
the captain walked the deck excitedly, keeping a glass
of spirits standing near him on the binnacle-head.
He often looked aloft, and talked to himself.  At one
of these times, a little dog he had ran between his
legs and nearly capsized him.  With a fierce oath he
took the poor animal up by the neck, and threw it
into the sea.
</p>

<p>
On this, the sailors looked darkly in each other's
faces, and felt sure that mischief was soon to
follow.
</p>

<p>
The mate and Joe Rudderford now suggested
respectfully, that, as the fog was deepening and the
wind freshening, some of the canvas should be taken
off the ship; but, in a gust of fury, the captain, instead
of adopting their advice, had her trimmed before the
wind, the yards squared, and the fore and main
studding-sails hoisted to port and starboard.  Willie
Rudderford was at the wheel.
</p>

<p>
The seamen grew pale, and muttered under their
breath as they obeyed the rash orders, and belayed the
tackle.
</p>

<p>
'What do you think of all this, Joe?' I whispered.
</p>

<p>
Joe answered only by a grunt, whatever that might
mean; but on board, it always seemed that a grunt
from old Joe had more weight than a whole speech
from any other man.
</p>

<p>
'I think we should take some of the canvas off
her,' said he to me, after a pause, loud enough for the
captain to hear.
</p>

<p>
On this, the skipper turned round furiously; but
before he could say anything, there went up a cry
through all the ship from stem to stern&mdash;I think I
hear it still.
</p>

<p>
'May the Lord have mercy on us!' was the fervent
prayer uttered by more than one brave fellow, as
death seemed suddenly inevitable, when the ship went
bump ashore with a frightful crash, and a horrible
grinding sound followed.
</p>

<p>
'All is lost!  Let every man shift for himself!'
cried the helpless man who commanded us.
</p>

<p>
The three topmasts crashed off at the tops, with
the fury of the shock, and with the yards and hamper
fell heavily down over the yet inflated canvas, to port
and starboard.  Aloft we were a total wreck in a
moment, and already going to pieces below.
</p>

<p>
Our new captain&mdash;a very different man from the
gallant Archibald, who was killed in the fight off the
coast of Swatow&mdash;was the first to perish, overwhelmed,
apparently, amid the boiling surf in the dingy, in which
he and the first mate tried to effect their escape.
</p>

<p>
Amid the gloom, I saw Joe and Willie Rudderford
grasp each other's hard hands for a moment, as their
minds, like mine, were doubtless filled with a thousand
hurrying thoughts of home and distant
friends&mdash;remembering, perhaps, former happiness, and
contrasting it with the present danger and misery.
</p>

<p>
Horror had succeeded the first consternation and
alarm into which the entire crew were thrown by this
sudden and unexpected catastrophe.  The afterpart
of the hull was covered with water, but the bows were
jammed hard and fast upon the rocks, where the boiling
sea made clean breaches over them, washing away
those who crouched there.  By one of these seas I
was swept overboard, and in a few moments I rose to
the surface, feeling battered and bruised, with the salt
water gurgling in my throat and whizzing in my
ears.
</p>

<p>
I was washed towards some rocks, into the seaweed
of which I dug my hands and clung to it, even with
my teeth.  For a moment the sea seemed to leave
me, and I felt suspended above it.  Then it rose again
with tremendous force, and took me from my hold.  I
forgot all about the ship, and those who were perishing
there; I thought only of myself, of self-preservation,
and the dread of death.  In that supreme
moment of terror and agony I seemed to live a lifetime!
</p>

<p>
Again I rose to the surface on the summit of the
wave, which washed me along the slippery face of
the rocks, and ere it descended I caught some
seaweed again, above the point where I had been before,
and again the water left me, suspended in air, and
gasping for life.
</p>

<p>
Sea after sea rose again, but none reached me now,
and the waves only hissed and burst against the rocks
below me, as if infuriated at having lost their prey.
</p>

<p>
Once more I began to respire more freely, and
hope grew in my heart&mdash;the hope that I might yet
live.
</p>

<p>
Then the dread that I might be sucked down by
some wave more powerful than the rest caused me
to make an effort, which then seemed to me super-human,
to gain a footing; and slowly and laboriously
I climbed upward to where even the highest spray fell
far short of me; and in my heart I thanked God that
I was safe, though where, or on what isle, I knew
not.
</p>

<p>
In the mist and darkness I ascended some fifty feet
to a species of dry plateau ere I ventured to stop and
rest, and then I heard what, amid my own trouble and
terror, had partly escaped my ear: the roar of the
breakers below, with the shrill shrieks of our perishing
crew.
</p>

<p>
'For pity's sake help me, whoever you are!' cried a
voice a little below me; and, extending a hand to one
of our people who had reached a shelf of rock, I
assisted him upward, and he proved to be Willie
Rudderford, sorely battered and bruised, having been
dashed repeatedly against the cliffs; and now we
began to ascend higher together.
</p>

<p>
I asked for Joe, the boatswain; but Willie only
knew that they had been torn asunder by the waves
that had swept him overboard, and he had not seen
him again.
</p>

<p>
Panting and often breathless, drenched and sodden,
clinging to the rocks, we continued to ascend, so far
that even the booming of the sea began to sound
faint; and then we lay down together, worn out, yet
past all thoughts of sleep, to await the coming day
and whatever might betide us.
</p>

<p>
The cold was beyond all description, and, but for
the shelter an elevation of the rocks afforded us, we
must have perished, as we lay there huddled close
together for mutual warmth, while ever and anon
Willie Rudderford lamented sorrowfully the too
probable loss of his brother.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the grey dawn stole in, and the mist that
enveloped the land melted away; and, to make my
story brief, we found by degrees that seventeen of the
ship's company, including Joe Rudderford and our
two selves, had survived the catastrophe, and that we
were shipwrecked on the Crozets&mdash;those horrible isles
that lie in the Southern Pacific, out of the track of all
vessels!
</p>

<p>
We could scarcely congratulate ourselves upon our
escape, and some there were among us who bitterly
regretted that they had not perished with the rest.
</p>

<p>
Out of the fore-part of the wreck we contrived to
get some tins of preserved meat and a cask of
gunpowder, after which she heeled over into deep water
and disappeared; and a sigh escaped my lips as we
saw the last of our floating home&mdash;the good old <i>Bon
Accord</i>.
</p>

<p>
No island in the world could be more desolate than
the one on which we found ourselves.  Lashed by
tempests, and surrounded by an ever-boiling sea,
never visited save by some adventurous whaler, that
solitary archipelago, the Crozets, does not possess one
human being!
</p>

<p>
Under Joe Rudderford, to whom we all turned now,
we began the dreary work of exploration, and found
that we were on a long, gaunt, and naked isle a few
miles in extent, without trees or verdure, and exposed
to surf and the bitter blasts of the Southern Arctic
winter.
</p>

<p>
Our boats had all been swamped or dashed to
pieces, so that we had no chance or means of crossing
to any of the larger islands which were visible, and on
this miserable reef we must remain and exist as best
we might.
</p>

<p>
Joe discovered a spring of pure water.  'Thus,'
said he, 'we are sure of the one great necessity of
life.'
</p>

<p>
Of food we had certainly one great source&mdash;the
sea-birds frequenting the spot.  An incredible number
of albatrosses, frigate-birds, and gulls were resident
on the isle; their eggs were found everywhere, and
they and their young, being all unused to man, became
an easy prey, as we could capture them by the hand
or knock them over by a stick.
</p>

<p>
'Thank Heaven,' said Joe, 'we have food and drink
provided, and it will go hard if our self-help and
sagacity as British sailors don't do the rest for us.'
</p>

<p>
Everything that was cast in from the wreck was
carefully brought on shore and stored up.  By Joe's
orders, we placed a spare topmast on an eminence,
with a blanket, as a flag, attached thereto, and a regular
watch was told off beside it, to signal any passing
vessel.  Rude shelters of stones were set up for weak
or ailing men among us; Joe divided us into messes,
and made arrangements for the distribution of the
birds, the eggs, and all else that was in our general
stock.
</p>

<p>
We required a moving and ruling spirit, and Joe
took that place.
</p>

<p>
By his orders we utilised the preserved meat-tins
as cooking vessels, and by partaking of certain coarse
herbs and wild grasses, boiled therein, we averted all
danger of scurvy.
</p>

<p>
For fuel we had at first the broken driftwood that
came from the wreck; but this was soon, with all our
care, expended, and the cold would perhaps have
destroyed us, had not the indefatigable Joe discovered
that we could make fires of the bones and skins of the
seafowl; and Joe, who was a well-read Scotsman, told
us all how Dr. Livingstone once fed the fires of his
steam-boat on the Rovuma River with elephants' ribs.
</p>

<p>
The success of our plan, to feed fires with the legs
of albatrosses, gulls, and kittiwakes, for the many
months that we did, proves the vast number we must
have caught; but weary indeed were we of this daily
menu of eggs and oily sea-bird flesh, seasoned with
salt obtained from the surf where it dried on the
rocks.
</p>

<p>
I shall never forget the great horror that fell on us,
when one of our little band died of a fatal gangrene,
having injured his foot by a fall; and as we buried
him in the sea came the dread question, if we were
all fated to perish in succession, who among us would
be the <i>last</i> and lonely man upon that rocky isle?
</p>

<p>
Save for the lucky accident that several among us
had match-boxes in their pockets when quitting the
wreck, we could never have lighted a fire!  As the
ship broke up, various things came ashore; among
others, a passenger's chest, wherein we found some
blankets, knives, and spoons.
</p>

<p>
So passed away August and September, and all
this dreary time, a keen look-out was kept from the
first break of dawn to the last glimpse of sunset for
any passing sail, as life depended upon rescue.  We
often marvelled whether any vessel ever passed in
the night, as we had no fiery beacon to attract
attention.
</p>

<p>
Finding themselves preyed upon, the sea-birds
became wilder, and food grew scarce.  It is easy
to imagine the agony in which, with haggard eyes
and wildly beating hearts, we twice saw the sails of
passing ships; but they were 'hull down,' at a vast
distance, and could not see our despairing signals.
</p>

<p>
At length there came a day&mdash;oh, never, never shall
I or any who were with me then forget it!
</p>

<p>
The morning broke warm, fine, and sunny, and a
shout came from the watch at the beacon, that 'a ship
was close in shore!'
</p>

<p>
We started up from the shelter where we were
sleeping.  We could scarcely believe our eyes, as with
prayerful hearts we stretched out our hands
simultaneously and in silence towards her.
</p>

<p>
Yes&mdash;yes! there she was, little more than a mile
distant, a gallant brig of considerable burden, with
her courses, topsails, and top-gallant-sails set, close
hauled on the port tack, on a gentle breeze.
</p>

<p>
We were incapable of shouting or cheering, so great
was our emotion, and many of us burst into tears when
we saw the sheets let fly and the fore-yard thrown in
the wind, while, as an additional token that we were
seen and that succour was coming, the Stars and
Stripes of America were run up to the gaff-peak, and
a boat was instantly lowered and manned.
</p>

<p>
She proved to be the <i>President</i>, whaler, who, fishing
in that lonely sea, had by chance come near the isle,
where her morning watch had at dawn seen the
fragment of our tattered blanket waving in the wind.
</p>

<p>
We were speedily taken off, after having spent&mdash;as
a tally kept by Joe Rudderford showed&mdash;exactly one
hundred and fifty-nine days (a little more than five
months) on an isle of the Crozets; and, with one
accord, we all stood bareheaded, and thanked God
for all His goodness to us, when we found ourselves
safe on the deck of the American.
</p>

<p>
Her captain made us all welcome and comfortable;
but as we were what he called 'a tight fit' on board,
with his own ample crew, he landed us at the Cape of
Good Hope.  There I parted company with Joe
Rudderford and his brother, who shipped on board a
Scotch clipper to return to their own home, while I,
with the rest of the survivors, came back by a
passenger steamer to London, and found that my people
had long since given me up as dead.

<h3>
A TALE OF THE RETREAT FROM CABUL.
</h3>

<p>
'In the month of October&mdash;I won't mention the
year, it seems so long ago&mdash;my then regiment, the
gallant old 13th Light Infantry, with the rest of Her
Majesty's troops who had the ill-luck to accompany
us, were in the cantonments of Cabul.
</p>

<p>
'I can see them yet, in memory, on the plain in
front of the mountain city, enclosed by walls and
hedges, and bordered by those pretty villas which, in
their perfect confidence in the people, among whom
we had come to replace Shah Sujah on his throne,
our officers had built for themselves and families; on
one hand the hills of the Siah Sung, on the other the
haunted heights of Beymaroo, for it was affirmed that
a demon of some kind did haunt them, and in the
distance the city of Cabul, with its walls and streets
of sun-dried bricks, the towering outline of its
Balahissar, and in the background far away the summit of
the Hindoo Kush, mantled with snows that never
melt.
</p>

<p>
'When not on duty, or when I could not hope to
meet Mabel&mdash;Mabel Berriedale, of whom more anon&mdash;I
was fond of wandering about with my gun among
the Siah Sung hills, and even into the Khyber Pass,
in search of the <i>hill-chuckore</i> or Greek partridge, wild
ducks, and quails, though frequently warned by
Vassal Holland, a brother officer, who chummed
with me in the same bungalow&mdash;and once, to my
delight, by Mabel herself&mdash;that it was unsafe, because
ugly rumours were afloat, rumours of which she heard
more than we did, as her father was on the
headquarter staff&mdash;that it was both unsafe and unwise to
do so, as a rising of the tribes against us was almost
daily expected.
</p>

<p>
'What took us there? you may ask.  Well, the
same interest that may take us there again.  With
the view of frustrating the presumed designs of
Russia, and securing as far as practicable the
integrity of Afghanistan as a barrier against the
aggressive attempts of that ever-grasping power, the Indian
government resolved on the restoration of the Shah
Sujah, a cruel and merciless old prince, who, after
blinding with his own dagger his kinsman Futteh
Khan, had been exiled.  We replaced him on the
throne with an army of 8,000 wild Beloochees to
guard it, under the Shah Zadah Timour and Colonel
Simpson of the Company's service; but he soon
excited again universal hatred and dislike among
the fierce Afghan clans, who viewed us resentfully as
unbelieving intruders.  Thus the slender British force
of 4,000 strong, which as allies occupied the cantonments
I have mentioned, was in a perilous predicament&mdash;a
very trap as it were, for between them and
lower India lay savage passes, manned by hardy and
warlike tribes, and everywhere the coming storm
grew darker as the unwelcome Shah proceeded from
one act of violence to another; while his retention of
a corps of Sikhs&mdash;the enemies by blood and religion
of the Afghans&mdash;as a body-guard, roused all their
rancour against him, and against us, whose
commander was General Elphinstone, a feeble, ailing,
and incapable old man.
</p>

<p>
'Such was the state of matters when Holland
warned me of my rashness, and more than once
declined to accompany me, and one day I certainly had
an adventure&mdash;not an exciting one&mdash;but one which I
never forgot, owing to subsequent events connected
with it.
</p>

<p>
'Though October, the weather was fine and clear,
for there, after February, there is only hoar-frost in
the mornings usually, till the middle of March.  Our
band had been playing at the usual promenade in the
cantonments, but I had quitted early; Mabel, whom
I loved very dearly, but to whom I had, as yet, said
nothing of that love, had, I thought, treated me coldly,
so I took my gun in a pet, and went forth among the
mountains, penetrating into one of the deep sheltered
glens that open off the Khyber Pass.
</p>

<p>
'Either the birds were shy, or I was preoccupied;
I saw only here and there a solitary crow and stork
till I came to a little ravine, in which stood a Khyber
tent of black blanket, with a large stone at each
corner to prevent it being blown away.  Its door, a
mere mat of reeds, was open, and there came forth a
pretty young Afghan woman&mdash;a wife, as I could see
by her hair being braided and her trousers of some
dark stuff; and though evidently but the spouse of
some wild hill-man, she wore strings of Venetian
sequins, and chains of gold and silver.  She was fair
and handsome too, though her nose was very aquiline,
and her cheekbones rather prominent.  As she
proceeded to feed a Cabul pony, from a gathered heap
of juicy herbage, I was just thinking what a pretty
sketch the little tableau beneath me would make,
when it received one or two rather startling accessions.
</p>

<p>
'Out of a grove of wild mulberry-trees, all unseen
by her, there came creeping slowly, stealthily, with
cat-like action, and velvety paws, an enormous
black wolf.  I could, from the perch where I stood,
distinctly see the hungry gleam of its eyes, its scarlet
mouth half open, and the steam from its nostrils.
</p>

<p>
'At the same moment on the other side of the
narrow ravine, there appeared a Khyberee, as his
yellow turban and shaggy robe of camel's hair
announced&mdash;a tall, strong and stately fellow, armed
with his long juzail or native rifle, the lighted match
of which was smoking.  On his knee he took a steady
aim at the wolf, but missed fire.
</p>

<p>
'A cry of rage and fury escaped him, but it
mingled with the report of my unfailing double-barrelled
Purdey, and struck by two balls just behind
the ear, the wolf fell over on its back and pawed the
air, in the agonies of death, while the Khyberee
woman fled into her tent, and her husband, for such
the stranger proved to be, came to me full of
gratitude.
</p>

<p>
'"Sahib, from my soul I thank you," said he in
Afghani, of which I had picked up a smattering.
"You have saved my tent from a dreadful calamity,
enter it; from this moment you are the brother of
Zemaun Khan."
</p>

<p>
'For though but a poor hill-man he deemed
himself a Khan, and in evidence of his position in his
clan, as being what a Scots Highlander would call
a <i>dunniewassal</i>, he carried a falcon on his left wrist.
He led me within his tent, where I was in turn
gratefully thanked by his pretty young wife, for though
the Afghans do not, like other Mohammedan races,
universally shut up their women, they are as open to
jealousy as other orientals, and at Cabul frequently
resented the attention our fellows paid them&mdash;and
this added to those errors for which the army of
Elphinstone had to atone so terribly.  A snowstorm
came on, and thus I passed the night in the tent of
Zemaun Khan, who would by no means let me
depart.
</p>

<p>
'"You are welcome," said he, as his wife placed
before us food and a jar of native wine, though neither
would partake of it, "for in the fashion you have come,
a stranger is a holy name."
</p>

<p>
'"And yet," said I, smiling, "we Feringhees fear
you like us little."
</p>

<p>
'"Little indeed!" said he, as his brow grew dark,
"Sahib, I have seen and known your people&mdash;seen
them at their manly sports in the cantonments
yonder; seen the wonderful boat that Sinclair Sahib
launched upon the Lake of Istaliff, and the flying
shoes he used thereon when ice covered the standing
water,' he continued, referring to a boat which was
built, and skates which were made by Willie Sinclair,
an ingenious "sub" of ours, to the great wonder of the
Afghans, who had never seen either before.  "But
what brought you among our mountains?  Individually
you English are fine fellows&mdash;noble fellows;
but collectively we <i>hate</i> you," he added, while his eyes
and his set teeth seemed to glisten.  "Could it be
otherwise with us, who see that you are unbelievers
who deem that Allah is but a name?  But you are my
guest, let us not talk of these things.  We shall have
our pipes of tobacco, and Nourmahal shall take her
saringa and sing us the 'Song of the Rose.'"
</p>

<p>
'She brought us cherry-stick pipes, obediently
assumed her native guitar, and sang to us, as her lord
and master suggested.  The night passed pleasantly,
for the tent was in a sheltered spot; and I got up
betimes to return to the cantonment, escorted part of
the way by Zemaun Khan, to whose wife I presented
one of the pretty charms that hung at my watch-chain.
</p>

<p>
'As we parted within a mile or so of the cantonment
gate, he again expressed his gratitude to me,
but said to me impressively, and with a low earnest
voice:
</p>

<p>
'"If you can quit this place for Candahar or
Jellalabad go at once&mdash;go, and go quickly; in three days,
perhaps, it may be too late!  The hills will then be
alive with men."
</p>

<p>
'"You say either too much or too little," I
exclaimed rather angrily.
</p>

<p>
'"I have said what I have said.  The web of your
existence has been spun of the thread of sorrow, and
the sword of the Afghan will rend it asunder."
</p>

<p>
'"If a rising of the natives is attempted," said I,
"we shall not leave one stone of yonder Balahissar
standing on another."
</p>

<p>
'"Be it so; but," he added, pointing to the
stupendous mountains, "you cannot destroy these&mdash;the
fortresses given by God to the hill-tribes of
Afghanistan!  And Ackbar Khan has sworn an oath
that your whole host shall perish save <i>one man</i>, who
will be only spared to tell the fate of his comrades!"
</p>

<p>
'I had already heard something of this before, and
it had been a source of laughter, but for a time only,
in our mess-bungalow in Cabul; and that evening,
when Vassal Holland and I were discussing my
adventure, through the pleasant medium of brandy-pawnee
and Chinsurah cheroots, he laughed loudly
at the threat, like a heedless and handsome young
fellow as he was, and stigmatised Zemaun Khan as
"a melodramatic old donkey!  After traversing the
Bolan Pass under Willoughby Cotton, storming
Ghuzni, and then taking Cabul, we won't be so jolly
green as to take fright at the Afghans;" adding, "and
now to talk of something else.  I may mention that
your absence during the storm last night, and from
parade this morning, caused much speculation in the
lines, and, if it is any gratification to you, not a little
in the villa of the Berriedales."
</p>

<p>
'And he lay back in his long arm-chair, and
watched alternately the rings of smoke from his
cheroot as they ascended to the straw roof of the
bungalow, and the expression of my face.
</p>

<p>
'"Was Mabel indeed interested?" I asked, with
heightened colour.
</p>

<p>
'"More than interested&mdash;agitated! but I don't wish
to fan the flame, for I fear it will be no joke to be the
husband of such a girl as Mabel Berriedale."
</p>

<p>
'"Joke&mdash;I should think not, Holland."
</p>

<p>
'"What then?"
</p>

<p>
'"A great joy!  But to what do your remarks point?"
</p>

<p>
'"To begin with&mdash;her love of dress."
</p>

<p>
'"Pshaw! every pretty girl has that&mdash;and she is
lovely!"
</p>

<p>
'"In her opinion, her father the Colonel&mdash;or any
father&mdash;is only the medium for supplying luxuries
and pleasures, and to act as chaperon, if nothing
more attractive can be had.  A husband would soon
come to be viewed in the same light."
</p>

<p>
'"Pleasures, luxuries!" I exclaimed; "there are
deuced few of either to be had at Cabul.  But you,
the fortunate, happy, and accepted of her cousin
Bella should not talk thus.  You have surely been
refused by her!"
</p>

<p>
'"Refused?" exclaimed Holland, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes," said I angrily.
</p>

<p>
'"I never asked her, even before I saw Bella; yet
many an afternoon I have enjoyed her society very
much."
</p>

<p>
'"I should think so; she would make a pleasant
companion for a longer period than any Afghan
afternoon.  You mistake the girl entirely, in deeming
her, as I know you do, vain, trivial, heartless, it
may be."
</p>

<p>
Holland only continued to smoke in silence.
</p>

<p>
'"To-night at Lady Sale's, I shall put it to the
issue, if I can," said I.
</p>

<p>
'"Both will be there."
</p>

<p>
'"Allow us then to don our war-paint."
</p>

<p>
'The claw-hammer coat, and waiter-like costume
denominated "full dress," was not then etiquette in
India; thus, we both set out in full uniform for Lady
Sale's reception, which, though given so far away
from Western civilisation as the slopes of the Hindoo
Kush, was pretty much like any other.  The drawing-room
of her villa was made up as like one at home as
possible.  The ladies of the garrison, and of the C.S.,
had all becoming toilettes, and native servants, in
white turbans, were gliding about with silver salvers
of coffee and wines.  A buzz of conversation
pervaded the room, and though the band of "ours," the
13th Light Infantry, discoursed "sweet music" in an
anteroom, the tenour of the conversation, in certain
knots that gathered around the manly and
gentle-looking Sir Robert Sale, the commander-in-chief,
General Elphinstone, and the luckless envoy Sir
William Macnaghten, sad and thoughtful in aspect,
was the reverse of lively, for
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '"Great events were on the gale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each hour told the varying tale."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Dost Mahommed Khan, late ruler of Cabul, was
remaining a peaceful prisoner of the British Government;
but Ackbar Khan, the most brave and reckless
of his sons, had preferred a life of independence
amid the wilds of Loodiana, and now he was said
to be among the Khyber mountains, concerting
means for the extermination of "the meddling
Feringhees," as he called the British, whom he had
vowed to exterminate, all save ONE MAN!
</p>

<p>
'All this I had heard so often for some months
past, that it somewhat palled upon my ear now, and
I endeavoured to get near Mabel, who was seated on
a sofa immediately under a chandelier, which shed
down a flood of light upon her; and around her and
her cousin were a crowd of gay fellows in all manner
of uniforms, cavalry, artillery, and infantry; thus, I
could barely touch her hand, and answer some questions
concerning my adventure in the pass last night,
questions which I saw she asked with dilated eyes,
and considerable concern, when I had to give place to
some one else, with whom she plunged at once into an
animated conversation, as if to hide the momentary
interest she had shown in me.  This deeply piqued
me, all the more as Vassal, in all the happy
confidence of an accepted lover, was stooping over the
pretty head and snowy shoulders of Bella, and
eyeing me from time to time with a provoking smile.
Mabel and I were on awkward terms.  Her lover
she knew me to be, though I had never declared
myself, for two or three reasons, among the most
weighty of which were monetary expectations from
home; thus we had piques and little jealousies, even
fits of coldness, that made our almost daily
intercourse in the limited circle of the Cabul cantonments
perilous work truly.
</p>

<p>
'Her face was indeed a sweet and winsome one,
and once or twice, as a mass of her golden-brown
hair, which her ayah had failed to adjust properly?
fell suddenly about her neck, she gave a petulant
shrug of her white shoulders, while her beautiful
hands were upraised to confine the coils, showing
thereby the taper form of her arms and the contour
of her bust and waist, while many a "sub" looked
fondly and admiringly on.  Other handsome girls
were present, and it was really something wonderful
to see so much fair English beauty there in
Afghanistan, at the very back of the world as it
were!
</p>

<p>
'Her cousin Bella was a soft, yet sparkling little
brunette, whose father had fallen at the storming of
Ghuzni; since when she had lived under the wing
and care of her aunt, Mrs. Berriedale.
</p>

<p>
'To simply eye her admiringly from a distance
was not the <i>rôle</i> I had intended to adopt; but I
resolved to wait my opportunity, when there might
be some break in the circle around her, and was
passing into the inner drawing-room, which was
nearly empty, when I trod upon a pocket-book.  It
was a bijou affair&mdash;tiny, scarlet morocco, and
gilt&mdash;a lady's evidently.  To whom could it belong?
I looked round for Lady Sale, but she had left the
room.  The owner's name would doubtless be inside;
ere I could think of opening it, the book opened
of itself, where a leaf was turned down, and where
I saw&mdash;<i>my own name</i>, written more than once, with
another added thereto: "Mabel Clinton&mdash;Mrs. Robert
Clinton."
</p>

<p>
'I trembled with astonishment and joy.  She had
been wondering how the name would look <i>written</i>,
and written it was, in her hand, with which notes of
invitation had made me perfectly familiar.  I heard
the hum of voices in the next room, the sounds of
laughter, and the crash of the band in the
antechamber beyond, as one in a dream, for the discovery
now made was rather a bewildering one.
</p>

<p>
'That I had a place in her heart, that she was
more than interested in me, and that she linked the
idea of me with herself, I would not doubt, despite
her occasional coldness and coquetries with others;
but how was I to use the knowledge so suddenly, so
unexpectedly won?  It was alike dangerous to keep
or to return the book, though surely she would never
dream that I had opened and read it, but the hand
of Fate had done the former for me; and if thrown
aside, it would be found by others, and become a
source of secret joking in the cantonments, so I
source of secret joking in the cantonments, so I
placed it in the breast of my uniform, and seeing
her left almost alone for a moment, hastened to
capture her, and offer her my arm, which she accepted
at once, and we proceeded slowly to promenade the
rooms.
</p>

<p>
'"You have not been near me to-night," said she,
fanning herself, though the air was cool enough.
</p>

<p>
'"It is so difficult to get near you; you are always
the centre of a circle in whose unmeaning gaiety I
have not the heart to join."
</p>

<p>
'"You scarcely compliment me in saying this,"
said she, colouring a little; "I was fond of gaiety,
fun, what you will, when in Central India, and down
at Calcutta, but here we have been <i>triste</i> enough.
Cabul is simply horrible!"
</p>

<p>
'"And I wish, for your sake, and the sake of
many others, that we were well out of it; but it
was not of this everyday topic I desired to speak
with you."
</p>

<p>
'"Of what, then?" she asked in a low voice,
though we had now reached the lower end of the
outer drawing-room, where the windows were open
to the floor, and gave access to a veranda filled with
flowers, and the green jalousies enclosing which
rendered it a species of corridor.
</p>

<p>
'My heart beat lightly, and I was on the point of
saying something, I know not what&mdash;pretty pointed,
however, when, in an evil moment, I drew forth her
pocket-book, and said:
</p>

<p>
'"Does not this belong to you, Miss Berriedale?
your initials are gilded on the cover."
</p>

<p>
'"It <i>is</i> mine!" she exclaimed, while blushing
deeply, and then growing deadly pale, as she
remembered what she feared I might have seen, and more,
perhaps, that I had not seen; "where did you find
it?" she added with some sharpness of tone.
</p>

<p>
'"Lying on the floor, yonder, in the other drawing-room."
</p>

<p>
'"And how long have you had it?" she continued,
with an increased hardness of tone which chilled me.
</p>

<p>
'"But a few minutes; young ladies should be
careful&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Of what?" she inquired haughtily.
</p>

<p>
'"Miss Berriedale," said I, in agitated voice, and
endeavouring to take her hand; but she eluded me,
and even withdrew her arm, saying, "I must rejoin
mamma."
</p>

<p>
'She rejoined the large group near the chandelier,
with her whole manner and bearing totally changed,
while I followed her completely crestfallen, with the
eyes of Vassal Holland upon me, as if inquiring
whether I <i>had</i> put my fate to the issue, and what
had come of it.
</p>

<p>
'A vague sense of having incurred her displeasure
at the very moment when I was about to declare my
passionate love for her, oppressed me; yet, when the
time for departure came, and the carriages and palkees
were announced, I hastened to cloak her, but she
submitted in grim silence.
</p>

<p>
'"Will you pardon me if I have offended you?"
I whispered.
</p>

<p>
'"I have nothing to pardon."
</p>

<p>
'"Forgive me, then?"
</p>

<p>
'"I have nothing to forgive."
</p>

<p>
'"Good-night."
</p>

<p>
'"Good-night, Mr. Clinton."
</p>

<p>
'She did not even take my hand, and we parted.
</p>

<p>
'"What's up, old fellow?" asked Vassal Holland,
as we strolled away to our bungalow in the lines.
</p>

<p>
'"By Jove, I can't tell you."
</p>

<p>
'"You've not made your innings, any way?"
</p>

<p>
'"No," said I sadly and savagely; yet I could
have enlightened him as to the situation, had I
chosen, but unless I could have ensured his silence
with regard to Bella, to do so might have made
matters worse.
</p>

<p>
'She loved me, I could not doubt it, But she
feared I had <i>read</i> the secrets of her pocket-book&mdash;the
dear, stupid words she had written half in play;
and all her maidenly modesty was up in arms, lest I
should take advantage of what I had learned,&mdash;that
she had given her heart to a man ere he asked
for it, and that if I wooed her now, it might only be
out of compassion or pity, melting into love.
</p>

<p>
'I could not doubt that, but for the unlucky advent
of the pocket-book, she would have permitted me to
love her, and have fully accepted me, with her uncle's
consent; and now&mdash;now for days she avoided me, and
began, that was patent to all in the cantonment, a
very deliberate flirtation with my friend Jack Villars,
of the Horse Artillery, a handsome but heedless fellow,
whom she had never distinguished before; and, though
I knew not quite why, the life of us <i>both</i> was embittered.
I was indignant that she should think so meanly of
me as to believe me capable of deliberately opening
her pocket-book and prying into her secrets, while she
was exasperated at her own folly in writing what she had
written.  Had I seen it? doubtless she asked of herself,
and might have remembered that I had spoken of her
"initials;" and perhaps, had I made the most solemn
assertion that the wretched little book had opened of
itself, she might have failed to believe me.
</p>

<p>
'At last the route came for our regiment, with the
rest of Sale's brigade, to begin the march towards the
province of Jellalabad; and I shall never forget the
morning of our departure.  We were armed with old
and unserviceable muskets, because our final destination
was Britain, and General Elphinstone, a useless,
obstinate, and incapable old man, said there was no
use in taking new arms home.  Our men were to
march with their knapsacks, a new feature in Indian
warfare; and the officers reduced their baggage to a
minimum, for rumour said the passes were beset, and
the odds were heavy that not a man of us might live
to reach the lower end of them.
</p>

<p>
'On the cold, dull, cloudy morning of the 10th of
October our drums beat, and all in the cantonments
at Cabul turned out to see us depart.  Among other
spectators on horseback were Bella and Mabel Berriedale,
with the now inevitable Villars in attendance
upon the latter; and if aught could add to the sorrow,
bitterness, and chagrin of a parting that would be
final&mdash;as she was to be left behind in Cabul&mdash;it was
to behold this!
</p>

<p>
'After forming my company I drew near her, and
made some commonplace remark, to which she
replied in the same tone.  I failed to catch the
expression of her face, as a thick Shetland veil was tied
over it.  How little could I think that it was
concealing tears!  Suddenly Sale's bugler sounded; the
adjutant was about to tell off the battalion.  I pressed her
hand; she returned the pressure firmly, and her voice
as she said "Good-bye" was utterly broken, and
seemed to be full of tears.  I never, never forgot <i>that</i>;
but this was no time for explanation.  I rushed to join
my company, and all that followed passed like a
dream.  The brigade was wheeled into line&mdash;it broke
into sections&mdash;the bands struck up, and the homeward
march for England, as all our fellows fondly hoped,
began; and ere long, as we penetrated into the dark
recesses of the mountains, we saw the last of Cabul
and all our companions.
</p>

<p>
'I had but one thought&mdash;that Mabel Berriedale was
there, and that I should never see her again!
</p>

<p>
'Even the armed clans of Afghans that were seen
hovering so menacingly on the rocks that overhung
the passes could not draw my thoughts from Mabel,
the pressure of her beloved hand, and her tearful voice,
when it was too late&mdash;all too late!
</p>

<p>
'The following night some wounded fugitives
brought dreadful tidings to Cabul.  Sale's brigade,
they asserted, had been attacked in the passes and
literally cut to pieces; how Sale himself and Colonel
Dennie had been wounded, and Lieutenant Clinton
of the 13th had been cut off, with a whole line of
skirmishers, by the Khyberees under Zemaun Khan.
</p>

<p>
'My poor Mabel fell fainting on Bella's breast when
she heard of all this, and she now for the first time
knew, what I knew not, and never might know, how
really dear I was to her.  The startling tidings
brought to Cabul were not without some grains of
truth.
</p>

<p>
'Hardy and trained, the 13th, or Prince Albert's
Own, marched speedily and splendidly, setting an
example to the rest of the brigade, and their chorusing
merrily woke the echoes of the impending rocks; but
no actual hostility was displayed by the warlike
denizens of these until the troops were fairly
entangled in the deepest, steepest, and most perilous
parts of the passes.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Then</i> the cliffs above us seemed to become suddenly
alive with men, chiefly yellow-turbaned Khyberees,
who opened a storm of fire upon us that told
with dreadful effect, strewing the whole tortuous path
from front to rear with killed and wounded.  So
skilful too were these Afghans in the art of skirmishing,
that save for the red flash of their matchlocks streaking
the gloom, it was impossible to detect where the
marksmen lay.  Rocks and simple stones&mdash;some not
larger than a 13-inch shell, sufficed to shelter the
lurking juzailchee, who squatted down, showing, if
anything, only the long barrel of his deadly weapon,
and the tip of his turban.  Then might be seen the
hardihood, and the majesty, with which a British
soldier fights!
</p>

<p>
'Cheerily rang out the bugles of the 13th, for "the
leading companies to extend," and away the
skirmishers swept over the precipices, scouring the
terrible hills on the right and left, using the bayonet
wherever an opportunity served; and driving back the
wild mountaineers, till, just as night was closing in,
we came in sight of a mighty barricade of earth,
stones and turf, built right across the narrow pass,
for the purpose of cutting off all further passage or
progress.
</p>

<p>
'Sale, who was suffering acutely from a ball in his
leg, gave the order to storm it, and just as, with a
loud cheer, the leading companies assailed it with a
headlong rush, a ball struck me in the left ankle, and
my shako flew off; an invocation to heaven escaped me,
I fell heavily, my head came in contact with the rocks,
and insensibility rendered me oblivious alike of peril
and agony, as our men swept over me to storm the
barrier, which they did brilliantly, fairly opening up a
passage to Boothak, and carrying off all their wounded
save me.  I had fallen unseen, and in the dark was
left behind, while the flashing and reports of the
musketry died out in the distance.
</p>

<p>
'Bitter and terrible were my first emotions, when
the falling dew roused me in that savage place;
bleeding, helpless, unable to stand or crawl, a prey
it might soon be to Afghan knives, or the teeth of
those wild animals which would soon scent the dead
that lay around me.  I was not left long to reflect.  I
had just bandaged my wounded limb with my
handkerchief, when a party of Afghans passed.  One
uttered a hoarse cry, and was about to decapitate me
by one slash, when another interposed, and I found
myself the prisoner of Zemaun Khan.
</p>

<p>
'"Death to the Feringhee!" cried the astonished
Afghans.
</p>

<p>
'"Hold, I command you!" said Zemaun; "he is my
brother."
</p>

<p>
'"Is he not one of those who would send our chiefs
in chains to the Queen of the Feringhees in London?"
</p>

<p>
'"He is my brother!"
</p>

<p>
'By his order I was conveyed, not unkindly, to a
solitary round tower among the mountains, where I
remained a prisoner for longer than I care to remember,
with the terrible consciousness that I might be
murdered at any moment of caprice, or kept a
life-long captive, forgotten by all, while Mabel
Berriedale became the wife of Jack Villars, or some one
else.
</p>

<p>
'My adventures after this were so numerous that
they would crowd a three volume novel.
</p>

<p>
'The ball in my ankle I contrived to snip out
myself, nearly fainting as I did so.  I then bound up
the wound, which grew well rapidly; while that in
my head was bathed and bandaged tenderly by the
deft little hand of the wife of Zemaun Khan, who
was full of pity for, me, with much of gratitude for
the service I had done her, and thus I had perhaps
more of her society than the Khan might have
relished; but he had much wild work to do among
the mountains, and it was from her that I heard of
what was doing at Cabul.
</p>

<p>
'"Sahib, your people will never escape; it will all
be as Ackbar has sworn," said she in her soft Afghani,
as she drew near me and spoke in a low cooing
voice, lest others might overhear, in these rooms that
had only hangings and no doors.  "Sixty thousand
citizens in Cabul, and all the mountain tribes around
it are ripe for insurrection, and wait but the voice of
Ackbar."
</p>

<p>
'"But our soldiers are brave, and our envoy is wise."
</p>

<p>
'"Was, you mean, Sahib,"
</p>

<p>
'"How&mdash;is he dead?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes," replied Nourmahal, shaking her head, while
all the sequins flashed and glittered among the coils
of her splendid dark hair; "he was lured into a
conference with Ackbar, my husband Zemaun and other
Khans, by whom he was dragged away and beheaded,
in the face of your whole troops, who are now hemmed
up in their lines, a prey to hunger and despair, while
the passes are full of snow, and all the country up in
arms."
</p>

<p>
'I scarcely believed all this at the time, but she
never told me aught save the strictest truth.
</p>

<p>
'Hunger, cold and peril!  Poor Mabel! thought I.
On how little will a lover dwell with delight!  The
pressure of her gloved hand at parting, her broken
tearful voice, which said more than a thousand words,
and the remembered signature, all seemed to make
her mine, and yet I never might see her more.  I
must have been reported among the killed, and as
such wept for by poor Mabel, and in time to come
would be mourned by my dear old mother in England
far away.
</p>

<p>
'Every item of intelligence that reached that lonely
tower was communicated to me by Nourmahal, but, I
began to perceive, only when the grim Zemaun, with
his baggy breeches, black fur cap, and shawl with its
armoury of daggers and pistols, was absent.  I began
to perceive, too, that she was enhancing her great
natural grace and beauty by a costume such as she
had not worn in the tent, with a white silk camise
and pink silk trousers, and a thin veil of muslin
embroidered with gold, the use of which she managed
with great coquetry, especially when she idled over
the strings of her saringa; and she made wonderful
<i>œillades</i> under her long dark eyelashes, when singing
the "Song of the Rose," and other ballads in her
softest Afghani.
</p>

<p>
'"Sahib," said she one day, coming to me with
her dark eyes quite dilated, "pardon and departure
in peace has been offered to your people, if they will
leave all their women in the hands of the Afghan
chiefs; but they have refused, and only one cry is
heard in their camp."
</p>

<p>
'"And that cry is?"
</p>

<p>
'"'Let us fight our way down, sword in hand!  A
few of us at least shall reach Jellalabad.'  But they
will never reach it," she added sadly; "Aziz Khan
and Zemaun Khan have beset their homeward path
with 10,000 wild Kohistanees, and the Ghilzies&mdash;the
fiercest of Afghan warriors&mdash;hold the heights that
overlook it."
</p>

<p>
'I started to my feet as I heard all this, as if I
would be gone; but I threw myself back on the
camel's hair divan in a species of despair, as I knew
that the tower was guarded by men with loaded
juzailchees that would kill at 800 yards.  She
regarded me wistfully, and drawing near nestled like a
child by my side.
</p>

<p>
'"Has the Sahib a wife in yonder camp, that he
looks so sad?" she asked shyly.
</p>

<p>
'"No."
</p>

<p>
'"A sister, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
'"I have none."
</p>

<p>
'"That is well; you will have none to weep for."
</p>

<p>
'"How?"
</p>

<p>
'"Because, whether given as hostages in peace, or
taken as spoil in war, the Feringhee women will
become the gholaums&mdash;the slaves of the Afghan
chiefs."
</p>

<p>
'My blood ran cold and hot alternately as she
spoke, and something like an imprecation escaped
me.  She laid a hand upon my arm, and drawing
nearer, said in her most winning voice: "But what
is all this to you?  If you have no wife, no sister,
then what can the fate or fortune of the rest matter?"
</p>

<p>
'The name of Mabel rose to my lips, but died
there, for a new light broke upon me with a knowledge
of what my preoccupation of mind, during all
October and the subsequent weeks, had prevented
me seeing; that, influenced by pity, gratitude, and
the singular respect with which I, as a gentleman,
treated her&mdash;a respect to which she was all
unaccustomed&mdash;the wife of Zemaun Khan actually loved me;
and the knowledge of this filled me with only
confusion and dismay, for if he discovered the fact our
lives were forfeited, and already some of his household
might be suspiciously cognisant of it.
</p>

<p>
'"What is all this to you, I repeat?" she asked,
her clasp on my arm tightening.
</p>

<p>
'"More than I can tell you," said I, covering my
face with my hands, and striving to think.
</p>

<p>
'"Be comforted; in losing your friends, you have
not lost all who may love you&mdash;you have still <i>me</i>!"
she added in a low voice, as she laid her head in a
nestling way on my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'This was coming to the point with a vengeance,
and adding incalculably to the perils that surrounded
me; and how was I to temporise with this hot-blooded
and impulsive little oriental, whose sudden
love might quite as rapidly change to bitter
hate?
</p>

<p>
'"My God&mdash;could I but escape!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'"You can; but on one condition."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, name it!"
</p>

<p>
'"Take Nourmahal with you!" said she imploringly;
"she would die if left behind."
</p>

<p>
'"And die she shall!" said the low, concentrated
and terrible voice of Zemaun Khan, with a grim and
terrible expression of face, suddenly appearing in the
curtained doorway.
</p>

<p>
'A low wail escaped Nourmahal, who sank at his
feet.
</p>

<p>
'"I have heard all!" said he sternly.
</p>

<p>
'"All?" I repeated mechanically, and thinking the
word might be my last.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, all, Sahib, and blame not you."
</p>

<p>
'"Whom, then?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
'"Her!" he replied laconically.
</p>

<p>
'"She has done no wrong!" I urged; "I call
Heaven to witness!"
</p>

<p>
'"Silence, Sahib!  No actual wrong, but she is
morally guilty," he exclaimed, in a hoarse, fierce,
broken voice, as he spurned her with his heavy
Afghan boot; and then, as she crept grovelling
towards him imploring pity, but silently, like a dumb
animal, he added, "and thus do I, her husband,
punish her!"
</p>

<p>
'Then, quick as lightning, he drew, from among
the bundle of weapons in his shawl-girdle, a dagger,
and plunging it in her bosom, killed her on the spot.
A crimson torrent flowed over her white camise,
while the horrible dagger remained in the wound.
I say horrible, for the weapon was constructed in
such a manner, that after being thrust into the body
the blade, on touching a spring, separated into three,
thus rendering extraction impossible.
</p>

<p>
'This tragedy appalled me, and I looked wildly
round for a weapon, resolved to sell my life as dearly
as possible.  Zemaun Khan saw the action, and
smiled bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'"Your life is forfeited," said he; "but not while
under my roof.  I swore to be your brother for
saving the life I have just taken, though I might
have obeyed the fourth chapter of the Koran, and
immured her till death came; but such a process
would be too slow for me," he added, grinding his
teeth.  "You have eaten of my bread and salt, and
to that salt I shall be true till we meet among the
mountains; and then woe unto thee, Feringhee!  Your
people are departing&mdash;go forth and join them; but
their fate and yours is sealed.  Go&mdash;I have said."
</p>

<p>
'All that passed afterwards seemed like a dream to
me then.  I gladly quitted that chamber of horror,
where the poor girl-wife lay weltering in her blood;
a horse was given me, and a heavy tulwar or native
sword.  A wave of the hand towards the hills was all
the farewell accorded me by Zemaun Khan, and
turning my back upon the solitary tower, I rode in
the direction he indicated, which proved to be the
Khoord Cabul Pass.
</p>

<p>
'Night was closing in among these stupendous
mountains, which were then all covered with snow;
but as I rode on partly at random, thinking chiefly
that I might be pursued and destroyed by Zemaun
Khan and some of his followers, the sound of firing
in front began to reach my ear.  It became quickly
louder and louder as I proceeded, and ere long there
opened before me the long dark vista of a
snow-covered gorge, on both sides and in the centre of
which thousands of muskets were flashing redly out
amid the gloom, while their reverberated reports
mingled with a most horrible medley of sound.  The
British troops were being attacked; I could not
doubt it, and I rode on madly and furiously to join
my comrades.
</p>

<p>
'This was the night of the 8th of January, and, as
I afterwards learned, it was but two days before that
our whole garrison in Cabul had begun one of the
most disastrous retreats ever recorded in the annals
of war!
</p>

<p>
'It had been finally arranged by Colonel Berriedale
and the rest of the staff that, on the payment of
1,400,000 rupees to Ackbar Khan, Zemaun Khan, and
the chiefs of the Kuzzilbashes and Ghilzies, that our
troops were to march unmolested; yet the first-named
ruffian again recorded his terrible vow, "that
every Briton should be exterminated save ONE, who
was to have his hands and feet cut off, and be placed
thus at the mouth of the Khyber Pass, with a written
notice to deter all Feringhees from entering Cabul
again."
</p>

<p>
'The helpless sick were left behind; the ladies and
soldiers' wives were all in dhooleys or on horseback;
and the number of souls who quitted the camp is
estimated at 16,500 in all.
</p>

<p>
'As the troops marched on they were hemmed in
and impeded by the hordes of Afghan horse and
juzailchees, who with yells and shouts dashed recklessly
through the ranks, in fierce and savage mockery
at the wailing of the Hindustani camp followers, who
saw their wives and children slaughtered before their
eyes, or borne off, the prey of mounted warriors.
H.M.'s 44th, with horse and artillery, under Brigadier
Anquetil, formed the advanced guard; the 54th, with
some other horse and four guns, covered the rear, on
which a fire of musketry was opened from the
captured cantonments.  Soon the attack was general
on every hand, and the retreat became a disorganised
flight.  Horse, foot, and artillery&mdash;men, women,
children, baggage-horses, and ponies, were all wedged
together in the narrow way, where the corpse-strewn
snow soon became a bloody puddle, while a storm of
matchlock-balls poured down on the helpless column
as night closed in, and none could say who had
escaped and who perished.
</p>

<p>
'The aged and dying Elphinstone, with the ruin of
his army, halted amid the falling snow, without tents
and food, by the margin of the Loghur stream, hoping
on the morrow to clear the Khoord Cabul Pass;
but it was already in possession of Ackbar and
Zemaun Khan!  With dawn the flight, for such it
was, began again.  Among the wounded was Lady
Sale, who had a ball in her arm; and as Mabel had
her horse shot under her, Colonel Berriedale mounted
her on his own, and fought on foot, till a ball,
unknown to his daughter, laid him low.  A flag of
truce was sent to Ackbar, who shot the bearer of it,
the gallant Captain Skinner.
</p>

<p>
'Pretending he had no longer any control over the
people unless hostages were given, Ackbar thus
artfully got into his power, as such, General Elphinstone,
the <i>whole</i> of the women of the army and their families,
including Ladies Sale and Macnaghten, who were
conveyed back to Cabul; while the army, thus
degraded, continued its flight through the deep snow in
the dark and shadowy gorges, into which the Khyberees
and Ghilzies poured an incessant fire of rifles,
till the Tarechee Jungle, or Dark Pass, was reached,
where the whole 54th perished to a man.
</p>

<p>
'There it was I contrived to join our 44th, or what
remained of it, for in one group 200 of it had fallen;
and then I learned those dreadful tidings, which made
every heart in Britain throb, that the women of the
army, among them my Mabel and her cousin, had
been surrendered to the Afghans!
</p>

<p>
'"In all the world's history," said Jack Villars,
"there will be no retreat recorded like this!  That
from Moscow had its survivors; this from Cabul will
have <i>none</i>!  But have a cheroot, old fellow; it is all I
have saved out of my baggage."
</p>

<p>
'The terrible march was continued, and on every
side the rocks re-echoed the cries of "Death to the
Feringhees!  Death to the infidel dogs!" while the
wounded were always stripped and horribly
mutilated.  After a brief halt, at which some ponies
were shot, flayed, and eaten raw, on we struggled
again, on and on, under a shower of shot that
decimated us at every step, until we reached a place
called Jugdulluck, by which time every officer of rank
had perished; and there, on a knoll, under Jack Villars,
myself, and another, the wretched survivors, men of
all arms, made a last despairing stand against the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
'"Keep by me, Clinton!" cried Villars, brandishing
his sword; "we can die but once!"  He had
barely spoken ere he fell forward on his face, choking
and dying, with a ball in his chest.
</p>

<p>
'Cheering wildly, we stood shoulder to shoulder,
as if to welcome death; many of us faint and bloody
with open wounds; but showers of matchlock-balls
rained on us, and the roll of death increased as the
men fell across each other in heaps.
</p>

<p>
'The sudden fury with which we resisted here
checked even the ardour of the hordes that assailed
us, and we were permitted to struggle down the
pass, leaving the dead or the dying at every step, till
the 13th of January, when <i>twenty</i> officers and
<i>sixty</i> privates, the sole survivors of Elphinstone's
army, unable to proceed further, made a halt on a
knoll at Gundamuck, near a grove of cypress-trees.
</p>

<p>
'To all this violation of the laws of war, this terrible
treachery and lust of blood, was added a sense of
deadly horror as to <i>what</i> would be the fate of our
gently nurtured European women at the mercy of
men so savage.  Imagination ran riot, the heart grew
still, and we could but hope that ere this, death had
put an end to the sufferings of all.
</p>

<p>
'"My poor Mabel!" I could but gasp, rather than
sigh, at the thought of her.
</p>

<p>
'Our ammunition was gone, we were too weak to
resist with the bayonet, and, led by Zemaun Khan,
the enemy burst in among us&mdash;a sanguinary mob&mdash;and
with the knife alone slew every man there but
myself and two other officers, who, being mounted,
broke through, sword in hand, though all more or
less wounded, and escaped by the speed of our horses;
yet close at our heels came a score of mounted Afghans,
Zemaun among the number.
</p>

<p>
'They fired repeatedly at us, but their matchlocks
were useless on horseback, till some dismounted and
fired, taking deliberate aim over their saddles; thus
my two companions fell, and were instantly decapitated;
while I rode wildly, blindly on, with the blood
pouring from three wounds, and fast and fiercely
behind me came the pursuers, one outriding all the
rest&mdash;Zemaun Khan.
</p>

<p>
'Already the last of the pass had been left behind,
already the country was becoming more flat and
open, as I entered upon the plain, or rather valley,
where before me lay my only haven, Jellalabad, with
its minarets, domes, and those walls and bastions of
brick which had for months been held by the soldiers
of Sale's brigade.
</p>

<p>
'Could I but rid myself of Zemaun, I might reach it.
I checked my horse, and taking a Parthian aim at my
chief pursuer with the last shot in my pistol, saw him
fall from his saddle and dragged away rearward in the
stirrups by his terrified horse.  The act gave the
others time to near me, and I must have perished
within sight of the city but for a few cavalry who were
sent out to succour me.  I had been seen by Colonel
Dennie of ours, who made that remark which is now
historical.
</p>

<p>
'"Ackbar Khan has sworn that but one man shall
escape alive, and, by heaven, yonder <i>he</i> comes!"
</p>

<p>
'In Jellalabad my wounds were dressed.  I had
food, succour, and rest for the body, but not of the
mind, for almost the first tidings that Vassal Holland
had for me concerned our lost ones.  The ruffian
Ackbar had despatched the hostages, as they were
named&mdash;Lady Sale, Lady Macnaghten, and their fair
companions&mdash;towards Toorkistan, to be there sold
as slaves and bondwomen to the Usbec Tartars,
greater savages, if possible, than the Afghans
themselves.
</p>

<p>
'By this time the general was dead.  He had
expired in the tower of Zemaun Khan.
</p>

<p>
'I now remembered the words of Nourmahal, on
that evening which proved so fatal to her, that
"whether given as hostages in peace, or taken as
spoil in war, the Feringhee women will become the
gholaums&mdash;the slaves of the Afghan chiefs."
</p>

<p>
'"So they still live, Vassal?" said I, with a
groan.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes; but for what a fate&mdash;for what a fate!  I
would rather hear that my poor Bella were dead!"
</p>

<p>
'Eight months passed after this&mdash;eight months of
acute horror and terrible anxiety to all who had, as
we had, a tender interest in the lost; and common
humanity made all sympathise with such as Sir
Robert Sale, who had a wife and daughter in such
butcherly hands.
</p>

<p>
'How these months were passed, and all we did,
if detailed, would far exceed the limits of my story;
suffice it, that we joined the "Army of Vengeance," as
it was named&mdash;the army that again marched, but in
triumph, up those terrible passes which were literally
paved with whitening human remains and the bones
of horses and other baggage animals&mdash;the army which
drove the Afghan tribes like chaff before the wind,
fought victoriously the battle of Tizeen, and raised a
shout of triumph when it came again in sight of
Cabul, when the standard of Ackbar Khan was trod
in the bloody dust, and the flames of ruin enveloped
the great Balahissar.
</p>

<p>
'This was on the 12th of October, just about a year
from that night when I had seen Mabel Berriedale, in
all her girlish beauty, at Lady Sale's, and we had the
unlucky adventure with the pocket-book.  Ages
seemed to have elapsed since then!
</p>

<p>
'"I have news for you, gentlemen," said the white-haired
Sir Robert Sale (whose services dated back to
the wars against Tippoo Sahib), as he came hurriedly
one morning into the place which we had improvised
as a mess-bungalow, in the now ruined cantonments&mdash;"most
welcome news," he added emphatically, as his
voice broke and tears filled his eyes, "and doubly so
to a husband and father, like me.  Thanks to the
courage, diplomacy, and daring of Sir Richmond
Shakespeare, at the head of 600 Kuzzilbash Lancers,
the whole of the ladies have been rescued, when <i>en
route</i> to Toorkistan, and are now on their way to join
us here."
</p>

<p>
'He fairly broke down as he said this, and covered
his face with his handkerchief.  A half cheer rose
from the group in the bungalow, where there was not
an eye unmoistened.  Then Sir Robert looked up and
said:
</p>

<p>
'"In a few minutes we shall march to meet them!
There go the bugles of ours!  See," he added, with a
sparkling eye, "how the 13th are rushing to the
muster-place, actually belting themselves as they
come along!"
</p>

<p>
'Under Sir Robert's orders, in less than an hour
we had left Cabul behind us.  With the 13th Light
Infantry he had the 3rd Light Dragoons (now
Hussars), the first Bengal Cavalry, and a train of
mountain guns, to keep any wandering horde in awe.
</p>

<p>
'Light were the hearts of the soldiers as they
marched along.  Cheerfully had they ever marched&mdash;to
battle and siege, at Ghuzni, Jellalabad, and Cabul,
but more cheerfully did they now depart on their
errand of mercy and succour; and they marched
with a rapidity I have never seen equalled, save in
the advance on Lucknow.
</p>

<p>
'Vassal Holland was more hopeful than I was.
Dreadful doubts suggested themselves to me from
time to time.  I might hear that Mabel Berriedale
had died months ago; that she might have been
abducted for the rarity of her beauty, and that an
impenetrable veil obscured her fate!  Ackbar was
said to have appropriated one of the captives.
Heavens, if it proved to be Mabel!
</p>

<p>
'Her figure came before me as I saw it last&mdash;the
memory of her voice choked in tears, and the tremulous
pressure of her hand, while the warning bugles
blew, and it was too late to speak&mdash;too late to
explain!
</p>

<p>
'Ere long a dark group appeared advancing, with
glittering spears, out of a valley, as Sale's command
attained the crest of a hill.  It was Sir Richmond,
with the ladies and the Lancers!
</p>

<p>
'A shout burst from the soldiers, and actually
breaking their ranks, they rushed forward, and with
loud cheers greeted all, but chiefly Lady Sale and her
widowed daughter.
</p>

<p>
'In another moment I had both Mabel and Bella
in my arms, till Vassal drew the latter from me.
Many now met friends from whom they had long
been parted; as if in death.  Wives threw themselves
into the arms of husbands, daughters embraced
fathers, and the artillery fired a salute that shook the
hills of Jubeais.
</p>

<p>
'"Papa&mdash;I do not see papa!" said Mabel anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'"Lay your head on my breast, darling, and I will
whisper all!"
</p>

<p>
'"He is dead, then; and poor mamma too is gone!
I have no one in the world&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"But me, darling!" said I, as I kissed her tears
away and assisted her to remount.
</p>

<p>
'Here ends my story.  We were to have been
married when we returned to Old England had not
events occurred which I cannot tell you now, but the
results of which are swiftly passing away, and I shall
be soon able to call her my own after long years
of waiting, having had enough and to spare of
Afghanistan and the Khyber Mountains.'

<h3>
DICK STAPLES OF THE 'QUEEN'S OWN.'
</h3>

<p>
When I came back, boys, after my fighting in India
was over, you laughed at my old red coat (for I had
no other)&mdash;a trifle tattered, I dare say it was, as well
it might be, after all I had gone through in it latterly;
but you never forgot, boys, that it was the old Red
Rag, that tells of England's glory!
</p>

<p>
The company to which I belonged&mdash;the Grenadiers
of the 'Queen's Own' (for Grenadiers were not
abolished till soon after the time of the Indian
Mutiny)&mdash;was cantoned at Jubbulpore, in the month
of July, when all Bengal was seething with revolt,
and murder and outrage were occurring everywhere.
All was quiet as yet in Jubbulpore, which I may tell
you is in Berar, on the tableland of the Deccan; but
ugly rumours came from time to time about the 50th
and 52nd Bengal Sepoy regiments, who were stationed
at Nagode, the nearest post to us, and which, of all
the Bengal army, were eventually the last to revolt.
</p>

<p>
Neither tongue nor pen can describe what we&mdash;the
handful of Europeans among the millions of India&mdash;endured
at that terrible time, when the souls of fathers
and mothers, of husbands and wives, daily grew sick
with anxiety, while the atrocities of Delhi and
Cawnpore, and more than a hundred other places, made our
soldiers go mad in their longing for revenge.  But all
that is history now.
</p>

<p>
In the same cantonments with us was a regiment
of Punjaubees, who had as yet remained quiet; but
more could not be said of them, and we of the
Queen's Own watched them closely, for we were only
one to ten of them, and as no order for disarming
them had come, we pretended to trust them, and
affected a frankness and faith in our bearing with
them we were far from feeling.
</p>

<p>
Thus, cantonment life went on pretty much the
same as usual&mdash;the parade after gunfire, the officers
and ladies riding or driving on the course, or the
former idling in the verandas of the bungalows,
sipping iced drinks or brandy-pawnee, studying the
last Bengal <i>Hurkaru</i> or the thermometer; and the
pandies cooking their food&mdash;rice and chillies,
chupatties and ghee, under the glaring sun, in their own
lines, and careful that the baleful shadow of no
European passer should, during the process, fall across
it.  Our chief fear was that the approach of some
thousand natives and deserters, led by Koer Sing,
steeped in slaughter and flushed with conquest and
crime, might in an hour change the face of things,
and find us fighting for bare existence with the very
men who shared the garrison duty of the cantonment
with us.
</p>

<p>
Captain Basil Heron, who commanded us&mdash;a handsome
man, in the prime of life, a great favourite with
us all, and the leader in all manly sports and schemes
for our welfare&mdash;with Captain Dalton, who
commanded the Punjaubees, began to take quietly some
measures to render the Residency, the only brick
edifice there, more defensible than it was, a place
wherein to place the European women and children
in case of emergency.
</p>

<p>
Captain Heron had a wife&mdash;a fair and delicate
English girl&mdash;and one little child, on whom they both
doted; and when I saw the expression of haggard
anxiety their faces wore, and the faces of others who
had such charges to love and protect, I thanked
Heaven that then and there I had neither wife nor
child to care for, nor aught to look after but my old
'Brown Bess.'
</p>

<p>
Rumours that precautions were being taken spread
like lightning through the native lines, and Buktawur
Sing, the Subadar-Major of the Punjaubees, a
grotesquely ferocious-looking fellow, with a large hook
nose, and black mustachios of such enormous length
that they floated over his shoulders, went to Captain
Heron, and, with his base eyes full of tears, besought
him not to send the ladies and children out of the
cantonments, as the whole of his regiment had sworn
on the waters of the Ganges 'to be true to their
salt.'  Captain Heron heard this promise doubtfully; but
Mrs. Heron, who sat there with her baby crowing in
her lap, its fat fingers clutching at the golden curls
that clustered round her forehead, besought her
husband to believe him.
</p>

<p>
But although he salaamed and bowed very low
indeed, my particular chum and comrade, Bill Brierly,
who had been more than twelve years in India,
expressed to me his firm belief that this was all acting,
and that 'the time was at hand when we might look
out for squalls!'
</p>

<p>
And I was sure Bill was right, for I had been on
duty as an orderly in the veranda on the evening
when Buktawur Sing quitted the captain's bungalow,
and there was no vestige of his crocodile's tears as he
passed me; but a broad grin spread over his brown
face, and a cruel leer came into his eyes as he paused
for a few seconds, and listened to the voice of
Mrs. Heron, who was singing at the piano.
</p>

<p>
Despite the promises of Buktawur Sing, Captain
Heron, as senior officer, posted a picquet at some
distance from the cantonments on the road to
Nagode, to cut off communication with the two
regiments there&mdash;at least, to prevent any concerted
movement being arranged; and all postal matters
being then at a standstill, we knew little about what
was going on around us, but heard only vague and
terrifying rumours.
</p>

<p>
On a night early in July, I was detailed for the
picquet on the Nagode road, and Captain Heron
resolved to accompany it, though it was under
Mr. Drayton of Ours, a middle-sized and handsome fellow,
with a delicate-looking face, and much of that
self-esteem and imperturbable confidence of character
peculiar to many young Englishmen.  He had seen
service, too, and had on his breast the Crimean
medals.
</p>

<p>
As we paraded in front of Captain Heron's bungalow,
he came forth with his sword and revolver, and
his pretty young wife clinging to his arm.
</p>

<p>
'Are you compelled to go, Basil?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'No; yet somehow I feel impelled to-night; but
retire, Rose.  Good-night, dear&mdash;you look tired; to
bed, and pleasant dreams to you.'
</p>

<p>
'You have your flask and the sandwiches, and your
great-coat?'
</p>

<p>
'Everything.  How thoughtful you are!  Good-night,
and kiss baby for me.'
</p>

<p>
We marched out through the lines; but Mrs. Heron,
who had some sad foreboding, watched the
picquet as long as it was in sight.  Heron and
Drayton chose their halting-place and threw out
their advanced sentinels a considerable distance in
front of the picquet.  Of these, I was one, and my
orders were, on the advance of any armed party, to
fall back softly and silently, and communicate the
alarm.  Alone on my post there, keeping watch with
the stars, and the whole sweep of country before me,
memory went back to the old, or rather the young,
days of my boyhood, even to yonder old mill,
when I worked there; the rabbits in the brake, the
squirrels in the trees, the nuts and berries in the
hedgerows; till suddenly the galloping of a horse
roused me, and I cocked my musket.  The sound
came from the front!
</p>

<p>
Another moment and the rider was before me, and
reined up.  He evidently had heard nothing of the
picquet, and was enraged to find me barring the way.
By his uniform he was a subadar of the 50th
B.N. Infantry, and mounted on an officer's horse.
</p>

<p>
'The parole?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'How should I know it?  I have just come from
Nagode,' said he, in broken English; adding, 'Stand
back, Kafir!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh ho!' I exclaimed, as the epithet warned me at
once of enmity; and grasping his reins, 'What news
have you from that quarter?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Only that the faithful have risen at last, and not
one of the accursed <i>Ghora Logue</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, white people)
will be left alive&mdash;not even the youngling at its
mother's breast, and all in Jubbulpore shall perish
too!' he added through his clenched teeth, while his
eyes blazed with fury, and he attempted to draw his
sword; but ere he could do so, and as his horse rose
on its haunches for an onward bound, I jerked the
powerful curb with such violence to the rear, that
ere the sword had left its scabbard, man and horse
were prostrate on the road&mdash;the former stunned
and senseless.  In a moment more I was in his
saddle and galloping back to report to Captain
Heron all I had heard from the envoy of the mutineers.
</p>

<p>
The picquet had barely got under arms when a
great hubbub was heard coming on from the front,
but no appearance of armed men, though the moon
had now shone forth.  It was chiefly the rolling of
wheels and clatter of hoofs, and ere long there came
up a wild and terrified throng of European fugitives
from Nagode&mdash;dishevelled women, exasperated men,
and wailing children.  In a word, on the approach of
the rebels under Koer Sing, the 50th and 52nd had
broken out into open mutiny; but, by some merciful
interposition of Providence, had permitted their
officers, with their families, to fly to Jubbulpore,
where they hoped for a time, at least, to find
protection and safety.
</p>

<p>
Captain Heron was in the act of promising both,
when a cry escaped him, for a sound of scattered
musket-shots was heard in our rear, and flames were
shooting up from every quarter of the cantonments of
Jubbulpore.
</p>

<p>
'The Punjaubees have revolted!' exclaimed everyone.
The sentinels were called in, and the picquet
fell back at 'the double'&mdash;every heart beating wildly.
Upwards of thirty straw-roofed bungalows and
innumerable haystacks were blazing at once, casting a
lurid glare on the country for miles around; great
pinnacles of wavering and many-coloured flames,
with huge volumes of smoke, rose into the air of the
sultry night, the roar of the conflagration mingling
with the yells of the rioters and the shrieks of the
perishing.
</p>

<p>
Under Buktawur Sing, whom some other messenger
had reached, the Punjaubees had revolted,
looted and destroyed the bungalows, and gone off to
Nagode, killing every European who failed to reach
the Residency, taking with them, 'as hostages,'
Mrs. Heron, with her baby, and a Lieutenant Macgregor.
Wild wrath swelled up in all our hearts, as we looked
around us, and collected the dead&mdash;the gashed bodies
of brave men, of helpless women and children; and I
shall never forget the face of Captain Heron, as he
clung to Mr. Drayton's arm, and looked at the flaming
bungalow to which he had brought his bride last year.
</p>

<p>
'Henceforth,' said he, 'life will seem a blank behind
me&mdash;worse than all, a blank before me, with a memory
floating through it&mdash;the memory of her, and our poor
little baby!' and he covered his face with his hands.
'My poor little wife! that I should have been so near,
and yet utterly powerless to save her!'
</p>

<p>
'Hold up, bear up, for Heaven's sake, old fellow!' I
heard Drayton say; 'surely even these wretches will
not have the heart to hurt a hair of her head.'
</p>

<p>
But Basil Heron answered only with a groan, yet
not a tear escaped him.  His grief and horror seemed
too deep for even tears; every man of the Queen's
Own there, felt that he could face death or anything
to rescue her and make him happy; but too probably
only unavailing vengeance was left to us!  However,
we had no time for much reflection.  We took up our
quarters in the Residency, all that were left of us,
resolved, if attacked, to sell our lives as dearly as
possible.
</p>

<p>
We entrenched and fortified it to the best of our
means.  The verandas were bricked up, leaving only
loopholes to fire through.  Sandbags were placed all
round the roof, which was flat; we staked the ground
all about it to prevent a rushing attack, laid in grain
for three months, and got two field-pieces planted in
front of the house, to command the approach.  We
had in our care ten ladies, a number of sergeants and
writers' wives, and ever so many children.  In all we
numbered now only about fifty fighting men, including
officers, to furnish guards night and day, as we were
in hourly expectation of an attack.  Poor Captain
Heron&mdash;the ghost of his former self&mdash;superintended
all this, but day by day went past without tidings of
his wife and child, and he would rather have known
that they were lying, where so many others lay, in
the burial-pit close by, in rest and peace, than endure
the awful uncertainty that he did as to their fate.
</p>

<p>
After a time we heard that the rebels and mutineers
of that quarter were all massed, and living riotously,
under the ex-Subadar-Major Buktawur Sing, in a
place called Kuttingee, ten miles from Jubbulpore.
They numbered several thousands&mdash;too strong for us
to attack, and not even to save his wife dared Captain
Heron risk the lives of his soldiers.  And now it was
that my comrade, Bill Brierly, came so manfully to
the front.  He was a queer fellow, Bill, and early in
life had been&mdash;so the Queen's said&mdash;a strolling player.
He was always merry and laughing, sang a good
song, and was up to all kinds of larks; so now he
volunteered to go to Kuttingee disguised as a
<i>budmash</i>&mdash;one of the idle and rascally sort of irregular
soldiers who loaf about bazaars, and are up to all
kinds of mischief&mdash;and as such try to obtain some
tidings of Mrs. Heron.
</p>

<p>
'Fifty guineas&mdash;aye, all I have in the world&mdash;are
yours for any news you bring me, Brierly; even if
they be evil,' said the captain, in a broken voice.
</p>

<p>
'Sir, I don't do this for money,' replied Bill; 'but
for love of yourself and the poor young lady, who
was so kind to me when in hospital&mdash;down with
jungle fever.  I risk my life daily for a shilling; why
should not I do so, once at least, for her?'
</p>

<p>
'God bless you, Brierly!' said the captain, wringing
his hand.  'God bless you!'
</p>

<p>
How I envied Bill, and would gladly have gone
with him, but he&mdash;used to acting, knowing the lingo
and the ways of the country, and how to comport
himself&mdash;could alone perform the perilous task he
undertook, knowing well, too, the while, that if he fell
into the enemy's hands by being discovered, he would
suffer a death as elaborately cruel as these barbarians
could devise.  He attired himself in a blue silk
koortah, over a muslin shirt; a yellow-coloured chintz
was wrapped round his shoulders; he wore a green
turban and white cummerbund, or sash, in which he
placed a brace of double-barrelled pistols carefully
loaded.  His face and neck to the shoulders and his
hands to the wrists were coloured with lamp-black,
the cork he used being dipped in oil to cause the
colour to adhere; and thus disguised, he left the
Residency, singing as he went&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Sing hey, sing ho for the army O!<br>
  Sing hey for the fame of the army O!<br>
  A shilling a day is very fine pay,<br>
  Then buckle and away for the army O!'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And we watched him, as, after the heat of mid-day
was past, he took, alone, the road that led to
Kuttingee.
</p>

<p>
Three days passed, and as there was no sign of poor
Bill coming back, we began to fear the worst&mdash;that
'the niggers' had discovered and cruelly killed him.
</p>

<p>
After perils or risks that might be spun out into a
volume, Bill got past the outposts and sentries of the
rebels and found himself in Kuttingee&mdash;ostensibly a
<i>budmash</i>&mdash;willing to serve, for money or mischief,
Buktawur Sing, or anyone else.  Riot and disorder
seemed to prevail in every quarter, though for their
own safety the rebel Sepoys maintained a kind of
discipline, and had guards and sentries posted.  On
all hands were seen the plunder of villas and
bungalows.  In the bazaar, three European heads were
hung in a <i>bhoosa</i> bag, or forage-net, and Bill looked
at them with anxiety lest one might prove the head
of her he had come to seek tidings of.
</p>

<p>
Three days were passed without progress being
made; but on the third he succeeded beyond his
expectation.
</p>

<p>
When loitering near the gate of the fort, which
overlooked the town of Kuttingee, he jostled unexpectedly
a Sepoy in the uniform of an officer, all save a
huge green turban, who was about to enter the gate.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Chullo Sahib!</i>' (Come, sir!), the latter exclaimed
angrily; 'what in the name of Jehannum are you
about?'
</p>

<p>
Bill's heart leaped on finding himself face to face
with Buktawur Sing, the commander of all the rascal
multitude in the place!
</p>

<p>
'Who are you?' demanded the ex-Subadar-Major.
</p>

<p>
'Sookham Lall, a budmash, in want of a captain.'
</p>

<p>
'From whence?'
</p>

<p>
'Jubbulpore, last.'
</p>

<p>
'Jubbulpore!  What are the cursed Kafirs doing there?'
</p>

<p>
Bill described in somewhat exaggerated terms the
fortification and garrison of the Residency.
</p>

<p>
'We may bring guns against it,' said Buktawur.
</p>

<p>
'They too have got guns,' replied Bill, though he
knew that the Residency could no more stand a
bombardment than a house of cards.
</p>

<p>
'And now, what do you want here?' asked Buktawur,
his black beady eyes gleaming suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
'To kill your Christian prisoners, just to keep my
hand in,' replied Bill, grinding his teeth; 'you have
twenty, I understand.'
</p>

<p>
'I have only two here&mdash;the Sahib Macgregor and
the Mehm Sahib Heron (her brat is not worth
counting); there they are in the garden.'
</p>

<p>
Bill laid a hand on his tulwar.
</p>

<p>
'Not so fast, my friend,' said Buktawur, with a grin,
'for she is to be my wife; and if matters go hard with
me I may want the Sahib's head.'
</p>

<p>
'So they live yet!' thought Bill, as he entered the
garden of the fort, but dared not approach them,
though looking sharply at them, and viewing the
strong defences of the place, and the avenues that led
to it.
</p>

<p>
In a kind of alcove, excavated out of the solid rock
of the fort, Mrs. Heron&mdash;clad now partly like a native
woman&mdash;was seated with her baby in her lap, and
near her Lieutenant Macgregor, as if for companionship
or the sympathy he dared scarcely to manifest.
He was in the rags of his uniform, and both looked
haggard and wasted with the anxieties and troubles
they had undergone.
</p>

<p>
Bill drew near her, but at that moment a Sepoy
came to Buktawur for orders.
</p>

<p>
'Don't start, Mrs. Heron,' he whispered, 'or seem to
see or hear me&mdash;I'm Billy Brierly, of your husband's
company.  He is well and unwounded, and counts
every hour till he can rescue you.'
</p>

<p>
Bill then drew back, for now Buktawur Sing came
hastily and suspiciously forward.  Mrs. Heron looked
up.  Astonishment, gratitude and hope were
expressed in her eyes by tears, but not a ray of joy
shone in them; and honest Bill Brierly felt his heart
wrung as he looked on the poor lady, and saw now
that the baby she held in her lap was dead!
</p>

<p>
He mentioned this to Buktawur Sing.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Kootch purwanni</i>' ('Never mind'), replied the latter,
laughing to see her bending over it in the depth of
her misery, and playing with his little white hands
and flaxen curls.
</p>

<p>
'My little Basil&mdash;my little Basil!' she kept
repeating; 'my little sunbeam gone!  But safe now&mdash;safe
from peril and suffering&mdash;safe with the Good
Shepherd.  And I am here!'
</p>

<p>
As if to show his weariness or contempt of this, the
ferocious Buktawur Sing snatched the child from her,
and, with an imprecation, cast it into the alligator
tank in the centre of the garden.  She uttered a
wild shriek and fell forward on her face senseless.
Macgregor started to her assistance, but was driven
back by the sharp bayonet of a Sepoy sentry; and
Brierly, finding that he was powerless to give any aid
whatever, quitted the place, and with a sob for
vengeance in his throat, took the way back to
Jubbulpore.
</p>

<p>
Bill mercifully remained silent as to the fate of the
child; but poor young Captain Heron was never
weary of questioning him as to it and the unhappy
mother.
</p>

<p>
'It is a sore trial to me, Brierly,' said he, in a broken
voice.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir,' he replied; 'but He who sends the trial
sends the strength to bear it too.'
</p>

<p>
'Bear it like a man,' urged Drayton.
</p>

<p>
'But I must also <i>feel</i> it as a man,' replied poor
Heron, unconsciously quoting the words of Macduff.
</p>

<p>
And now came tidings that filled us all with grim
and stern joy.  The movable column of the Madras
troops, under General Miller, was on the march from
Dumoh to attack the rebels in Kuttingee, and drawing
out from the Residency every man fit for service,
Captain Heron set off to join him; and I can remember
how, on the march, he kept near the section where
Brierly was, for the latter had seen and spoken with
the creature <i>he</i> loved most on earth.  A ghastly and
haggard man Heron looked now&mdash;the shadow of his
former self.
</p>

<p>
Though it was only a ten-miles tramp, and, leaving
knapsacks behind, we had only our great-coats and
blankets to carry, I shall never forget that day's
march to Kuttingee!  It was one of thirst and toil,
with all our canteens and water-bottles empty.  We
pushed on under a noonday sun, under which the
parched earth seemed to pant like a living creature.
The streams were dried up, and all that was green had
become yellow and sickly in hue; the sky seemed a
furnace&mdash;the sun a globe of fire.  Clouds of dust
surrounded our line of march, and sand-spouts rose
at times; the ravens and kites gaped with wide-open
beaks by the wayside, and the alligators lay hidden to
the muzzle in their oozy tanks.  Fissures gaped in
the soil; the birds were hushed, and insect-life stood
still; the 'burra choop,' or Great Silence, as the
Hindoos call it, reigned around us, and we had three
cases of sunstroke; yet we pushed manfully on, and
when evening drew near found ourselves in front of
Kuttingee.
</p>

<p>
The first shot might be the death-knell of Mrs. Heron
and all other Christian prisoners, so the emotions
with which her husband surveyed it as he
marched the remains of his company into the assigned
position may be imagined.
</p>

<p>
The outworks of the fort were armed with cannon,
which opened on our columns as soon as they were
within range, and to which ours were not slow in
replying, and making a considerable slaughter of the
infantry that lined the summit of the walls and
towers, which their return fire seemed to garland with
flashes and smoke.  We of the Queen's, as a flank
company, had the Minie rifle (which by force of habit
we still called Brown Bess), and in closing up we took
cover under every bush or stone, and picked off the
rebels by steady pot-shots delivered from the knee.
We carried the outworks by a furious rush at the
point of the bayonet, and then slewed round a couple
of the heaviest guns, by which we blew in the gate
of the keep, or central fort.  Beyond was a traverse,
over which the rebels were firing; a tempest of balls
swept through the arch as the wind sweeps a tunnel,
and there fell many of ours, and among them poor
Bill Brierly.
</p>

<p>
Our loud hurrahs replied to the yells of 'Deendeen!'
('Faith!') and 'Death to the Kafirs, the Feringhees,
the Ghora Logue!' while maddened by bhang,
opium and churuis, the infuriated Sepoys met us hand
to hand, but only to go down on every side; for, with
our bugles sounding the 'advance,' we stormed the
traverse at a rush, and spread all over the garden
within the square fort.
</p>

<p>
We fought our way desperately.  'Remember the
ladies&mdash;remember the babies!' were our cries.  Near
the alligator tank lay the bodies of a European man
and woman.  They were those of Lieutenant Macgregor
and Mrs. Heron, before whom he had thrown
himself twice, as she was cut down by the tulwar of
Buktawur Sing, and the blood was yet flowing from
her wound when we found her.  As for the poor
officer, he was found, as the General reported, 'with a
hole through the neck, both arms broken, and his
body perforated by upwards of thirty wounds.'
</p>

<p>
I was an old soldier even then.  I had been in
many battles, and seen much of death and suffering,
but I felt a choking in my throat as I saw Basil
Heron, kneeling, sword in hand, by the side of his
wife for a moment, ere he rushed away, intent on
revenge.
</p>

<p>
Hemmed in a corner, amid a heap of dead and
dying, he ere long found Buktawur Sing, and, though
I did not see it, close and terrible was the combat
that ensued between them.
</p>

<p>
'At last! at last I have him!  God, I thank Thee!'
he exclaimed, with a fervour that mingled with just
indignation; and he ordered Drayton to stand back,
and the soldiers, who were ready to shoot the reptile
down, to leave him to his own fate.  Buktawur was
armed with a ponderous tulwar, edged like a razor;
and Heron, fortunately for himself, had not one of our
regulation tailors' swords, but a straight good-cutting
blade that his father had used in Central India.  His
teeth were set; he panted rather than breathed; his
check was pale&mdash;his eyes were blazing, and sparks of
fire flew from their swords at every stroke.  But fate
was against Buktawur Sing, he received in his body
a succession of cuts and thrusts that brought him,
with blood flowing from every vein, upon his knees,
and when his turban fell off, by one trenchant slash
Basil Heron clove him from the brain to the chin, and
with his foot fiercely he spurned the corpse as it sunk
before him.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
'Where is she?' he gasped hoarsely of me and others,
as he staggered back to the side of the alligator tank,
and found that his wife had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
'Inside the fort.  Calm yourself.  We have laid
her on a charpoy, poor girl!' said Drayton.
</p>

<p>
'My poor Rose! my poor Rose!' moaned Heron,
as he covered his face, and the hot tears streamed
through his fingers.  Through a place where 150 of
the 52nd alone were lying dead, he was led into a
darkened room, where, after the roar of the storm and
capture, all seemed dreadfully still.  On a charpoy, or
native bed, lay Rose Heron, and Sheikh Abdul Ali,
a native doctor, was bathing and binding up the
wound; and, nerving himself for what he had to look
upon, her husband drew near, and with trembling
hands drew back the mosquito-curtains.
</p>

<p>
Was he dreaming? was it a mockery or a delusion
that he saw Rose there&mdash;not dead&mdash;not even dying;
but with her eyes seeking for him&mdash;blood already
mantling in her pale cheek?  And he learned that
the blow of the felon's tulwar had&mdash;though cutting
her tender forehead&mdash;only stunned her, for the hand of
Macgregor had caused the blade to turn in his grasp!
</p>

<p>
Some bright beams often fall from the gloomiest
sky.  So husband and wife had met again, and&mdash;after
all they had undergone&mdash;survived to spend the
coming Christmas at home in old England, and to hear
the merry chimes in their peaceful Kentish village
ring out upon the frosty air the message of Peace and
Goodwill to All.

<h3>
THE STORY
<br>
OF
<br>
LIEUTENANT JAMES MOODY
<br>
OF
<br>
BARTON'S REGIMENT.
</h3>

<p>
The exploits of this adventurous but forgotten Scot,
who nearly perished miserably on an American
scaffold, like Major André of the Cameronians,
surpassed in some respects even those of Captain
Colquhoun Grant, the famous scouting officer of
Wellington, so extolled by Napier in his 'History of
the Peninsular War.'
</p>

<p>
During the progress of the strife with our revolted
colonists in America, he rendered himself famous by
the skill and audacity with which he intercepted
many of their mails and brought them into New York,
then the British headquarters after the Battle of Long
Island.  In May, 1780, when an ensign, with four
trusty soldiers he penetrated into New Jersey, for the
purpose of surprising Governor Livingstone, who
cruelly oppressed the royalists, but failing to achieve
his capture, his next idea was to blow up the magazine
at Suckasanna, which also proved abortive, as he
found it guarded by above one hundred bayonets.
On being joined by a few soldiers who had been taken
with Burgoyne at Saratoga, he entered the mountainous
county of Sussex, in the principal gaol of which,
he learned, several prisoners were confined for their
loyalty, and among them a poor soldier of Burgoyne's,
who had been doomed to death; merely for being a
royalist.  Moody determined on achieving the release
of this man and all the other prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Selecting six men he came to the gaol door late at
night, and his business was demanded by the keeper
from an open window.
</p>

<p>
'I have here a prisoner to put into your custody,'
he replied.
</p>

<p>
'Is he one of Moody's fellows?' asked the gaoler, at
a venture.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, exactly so,' replied the ensign, giving the
name of some noted Tory in the neighbourhood, and
desiring the keeper to come for him.
</p>

<p>
The latter declined, saying that 'Moody was about,
and he had orders to admit no man after sunset.'
</p>

<p>
'I am Ensign Moody,' said that officer sternly; 'I
have a strong party with me, and if you do not surrender
your keys, I will blow the place about your ears!'
</p>

<p>
His men now imitated the Indian war-whoop, and
shouted, 'The Indians&mdash;the Indians have come!'
</p>

<p>
On this the gaoler, his assistants, and even many of
the townspeople, fled to the woods.  Moody then
burst into the gaol through the window, and found
the condemned soldier in his cell fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
'There is no possibility,' says Moody's Narrative
(now out of print), 'of describing the agony of this
man when he saw before him a man in arms, attended
by persons he was utterly at a loss to recognise.  The
first and only idea that occurred to him was, that, as
many of the friends of the government had been
privately executed in prison, the person he saw was
his executioner!'
</p>

<p>
Moody released and carried off with him all the
prisoners, including the soldier, who, by a strange
freak of fortune, was afterwards taken again during
the war, and hanged in the same prison, and in virtue
of the old sentence, though we are told that his only
crime was 'an unshaken allegiance to his sovereign.'  This
seems barely probable, as another soldier, a
Scotsman named Robert Maxwell, was executed at
the same time for robbery and plunder.
</p>

<p>
On the 6th of March, 1781, when Moody was still
an ensign, the Adjutant-General, Oliver de Lancy, of
the 17th Light Dragoons, successor in office to the
ill-fated André, proposed 'an expedition into the rebel
country, for the purpose of intercepting the despatches
of Mr. Washington.'  Moody instantly undertook the
task, and marching his party twenty-five miles that
night, concealed them in a morass; but the guide lost
heart, which so enraged Moody that he would have
shot him, but for the sake of his wife and family, and
was compelled to return to New York.  Colonel de
Lancy was much disappointed; the guide was made
a prisoner, and on the 11th of the same month Moody
set forth again, and reached the Haverstraw Mountains,
which overlook the Hudson, amid a snow-storm,
and by the 15th he captured the despatches and their
bearer; but so great were the hardships undergone
that some of his men perished of cold and hunger.
For this, Moody, who had been one year a volunteer,
and three an ensign, was promoted to a lieutenancy.
</p>

<p>
About the middle of May the adjutant-general,
being in want of intelligence, suggested to Moody the
capture of another 'rebel mail;' and on the night of
the 15th he set forth with four well-armed men, and
after proceeding many miles, he found himself beset
on three sides by a considerable number of the
Colonial troops, who, having secret intelligence of his
movements from New York, were then in ambush
awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth side lay a ridge of cliffs, so steep and
rugged that to escape by it seemed impossible.
There was no alternative now but to surrender and
die, or leap down the cliffs, and in the dark.  Calling
on his men to follow him, the daring Moody sprang
down, and as the soil was soft at the base, they were
all unhurt, though seriously shaken.  They now
crossed a swamp, only to find themselves before a still
stronger party of the enemy when day was breaking.
To advance was impossible, as there was no doubt
that they had been betrayed.  They contrived to
creep away unseen, and travelled till they gained the
North River within four miles of New York.  Just
when Moody conceived they were out of all peril, a
party of seventy men, under arms, issued from a
wayside house, and opened fire upon him.  'He received
one general discharge, and thought it a miracle he
escaped unwounded; the bullets fell like a storm of
hail around him; his clothes were shot through in
several places; one ball pierced his hat, another
grazed his arm.  Without at all slackening his pace,
he turned round, discharged his musket, and killed
one of his pursuers; still they kept up their fire, each
man discharging his piece as fast as he could load;
but gaining an opportunity of soon doubling upon
them, he gave them the slip, and in due time arrived
once more safe in New York.'*
</p>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He departed again on the same perilous errand for
Pompton, on the 18th May, conceiving that the foe
would think they had sufficiently scared him from
further expeditions of the kind.  With four resolute
fellows, he crossed the Hakinsack river by a canoe
which he concealed among the long, rank sedges, and
soon fell in with an American patrol, whose object
was to prevent the conveyance of provisions to the
British headquarters.  He was ordered to stand or be
instantly shot.  With his four men, he fired, and then
gave an order as if he had a strong force in reserve, on
which the patrol fled.
</p>

<p>
A four miles' march brought them to the Saddle
river, which had overflown its banks; the night was
gloomy and tempestuous, and a body of American
regulars held the bridge.  He was thus compelled to
ford the river, a task of great danger and difficulty.
Rumour said that 'Moody was out,' and the mail
instead of being sent as usual, by the way of Pompton,
was sent by another way under a guard.  Selecting a
man whose voice, face, and tall figure resembled his own,
he sent him to a certain justice of the peace in another
neighbourhood, who at once fled to the woods, giving
out everywhere that Moody was <i>there</i>.  To that quarter
the Colonial troops were at once despatched, while
Moody captured the mail at another, and brought in
all the despatches relative to the important interview
between General Washington and Count Rochambeau
in Connecticut.  After this, Moody captured two
more bags of despatches, in one expedition being
aided by his younger brother, who must have been a
mere lad, as he himself was then only in his
twenty-fourth year.
</p>

<p>
In October, 1781, Captain and Brevet-Major George
Beckwith, of the 37th Regiment, then aide-de-camp
to Lieutenant-General Baron Knyphausen, informed
Mr. Moody that a person named Addison had suggested
a project of great moment&mdash;to bring off all
the books and papers of the Congress!  This
Englishman had held some inferior office under Thompson,
the Secretary to the Congress, and, being a prisoner
of war, it was resolved that he should be released,
return to his old employment at Philadelphia, where
Moody would visit him&mdash;Major Beckwith vouching
for his fidelity.
</p>

<p>
Moody undertook this perilous duty with the full
knowledge that Addison might deem him well worth
betrayal; thus he stipulated that the former was to
be kept in ignorance that he had undertaken it.
Moody took with him only his brother John and
another Scotsman, named Marr, on whom he could
rely, and a night&mdash;the 2nd of November&mdash;and place
were appointed where they were to meet the traitor
Addison, in the vicinity of Philadelphia.
</p>

<p>
They met him duly, but Lieutenant Moody kept a
little in the background lest his figure, which was a
tall one, might be recognised by Addison, who was
at once accosted by his brother and Marr.  The
former told them that everything was ready; that he
had obtained access to the most secret archives of
the Senate House, and that next evening he would
deliver up all the books and papers they were in quest
of.  Mutual assurances of fidelity were exchanged.
They crossed the river together in a boat for
Philadelphia, unaccompanied by Moody, whose first
foreboding or suspicion was a right one, for the perfidious
Addison had already sold him and his companions
to the Congress!
</p>

<p>
Pretending that the precise time at which their
plans could be executed was dubious, Addison
suggested that Lieutenant Moody should remain at the
ferryhouse opposite the city till they returned; and
before departing he told a keeper of it that the
visitor was an officer of the New Jersey Brigade,
which the woman understood to be the force of that
name under Washington.  To avoid notice, Moody
affected indisposition, and remained in a room
upstairs, but with his arms ready, awake and on the
watch.
</p>

<p>
Next morning he overheard a man saying to another:
</p>

<p>
'There is the very devil to pay in Philadelphia!
There has been a plot to break into the Senate
House, but one fellow has betrayed two who are now
taken, and a party of soldiers are coming to seize a
<i>third</i>, who is concealed somewhere hereabouts.'
</p>

<p>
On hearing this alarming intelligence, Moody took
his pistols, rushed downstairs, and escaped.  He was
not one hundred yards from the house when he saw
the soldiers enter it!  He attempted to gain shelter
in a thicket by leaping a fence, but found the latter
lined by cavalry, and got concealment in a ditch,
under the overhanging weeds and shrubs.  There he
lay for some time with pistols cocked, and heard the
soldiers pass and repass within ten yards of him.
From the ditch they went all round an adjacent field,
where he could see them probing the stacks of Indian
corn with their bayonets; and conceiving rightly that
they would not explore there again, when night fell
he sought shelter in one; and as his pursuers were
still about, he remained in an upright position in the
stack, without food or drink, for two days and nights,
enduring excruciating torture.  The stacks were
destitute of corn, being merely straw.
</p>

<p>
After a time he ventured, in the dark, to the bank
of the Delaware, and finding a small boat, while full of
grief for the peril of his brother and friend, pushed
off and rowed up the river; and though many times
accosted by people on the water, he replied to them
'in the rough phraseology of the gentlemen of the
oar;' and escaping unsuspected, after many adventures
and circuitous marches, all undergone in the
night, in five days from the time of his landing, he
reached in safety the British headquarters at New
York.  There was not the slightest hope that his
brother would be pardoned, for the treason of Arnold
and many recent events had infused much rancour
in the minds of the contending parties.  Tried by
court-martial, the two prisoners were sentenced to
death and executed.  John Moody was in his twenty-third
year, and on learning his fate, his father&mdash;an
old and deserving soldier&mdash;lost his reason.  The
American bulletin runs thus in the papers of the
time;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
PHILADELPHIA, <i>November</i> 14, 1781.
</p>

<p>
'On Thursday morning last, Lawrence Marr and
John Moody, of Colonel Barton's Tory Regiment,
were apprehended on suspicion of being spies.  On
the following day they were indulged with a candid
hearing before a board of officers, whereof the
Hon. Major-General the Marquis de la Fayette was president.
It appears that their business was to steal and
carry off the Secret Journals of Congress to New
York....  The Board having reported to the
Hon. Board of War, their opinion was approved, and Marr
and Moody were both sentenced to die, which
sentence was executed on Moody between the hours
of eleven and twelve; Marr is respited until the
23rd instant....  The enemy, who at this period
seem equal to no exploits superior to robbing mails
and stealing papers, may thank their beloved friend
Benedict Arnold for the untimely death of the young
man, who was only in his twenty-third year.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Of the future career of the adventurous James
Moody we unfortunately know nothing.

<h3>
'OLD MINORCA;'
<br>
OR,
<br>
GENERAL MURRAY OF THE SCOTS FUSILIERS.
</h3>

<p>
It is strange that the life of this old officer has
found no place in any biographical work; yet he was
the successor of Wolfe at Quebec, and as such
completed the conquest of Canada.  He defended Minorca,
and repelled with scorn De Crillon's offer of a million
sterling to betray that post; and who, when an old
lieutenant-general, was arraigned before a court-martial
by the brilliant Sir William Draper, whom he signally
baffled.
</p>

<p>
James Murray was the fifth son of Alexander,
fourth Lord Elibank, who in 1698 married Elizabeth
Stirling, daughter of a surgeon in Edinburgh.
Following the example of his elder brother Patrick, who
served as a colonel in the Carthagena Expedition
under Lord Cathcart, he betook him to a military life,
and on the 5th January, 1750-51, was lieutenant-colonel
of the 15th Foot, then on the Irish Establishment
(Millans' Lists).  During five years subsequently
his regiment was still serving in Ireland, and in 1757
he commanded in Sir John Mordaunt's expedition
to Rochefort.  On this service ten battalions of
infantry sailed from the Isle of Wight on board eighteen
ships of the line, attended by frigates, fire-ships, and
bombketches, under Sir Edward Hawke and Admiral
Knowles, on the 8th September, 'attended,' says
Smollett, 'with the prayers of every man warmed with
the love of his country and solicitous for her honour;'
but, like most of those buccaneering expeditions to
the coast of France which disgraced the reigns of the
two first Georges, it proved a failure.
</p>

<p>
The fortifications of Aix, an island at the mouth of
the Charente, and midway between Oleron and the
mainland, were cannonaded, blown up, and demolished,
at the cost of a million of money; 'after which,' says
Smollett, 'the officers, in a council of war, took the
final resolution of returning to England, choosing
rather to oppose the frowns of an angry sovereign,
the murmurs of an incensed nation, and the contempt
of mankind, than fight a handful of dastardly militia.'
</p>

<p>
Charged with disobedience of orders and instructions,
Sir John Mordaunt was arraigned at Whitehall
before a court-martial, which sat for six days, from
the 14th to the 20th December, 1758.  Among the
members were Lord Tyrawly, Brigadier Huske (who
was engaged at Falkirk), and Colonel William Kingsley,
of Minden fame, the ancestor of the author of 'Alton
Locke.'  Wolfe was a witness for the prosecution, as
was also 'Mr. Secretary William Pitt;' and among
those for the prisoner was Colonel Murray of the 15th,
Cornwallis, and the two admirals.  By the court
Mordaunt was unanimously acquitted.
</p>

<p>
We next find James Murray at the capture of
Louisbourg, in 1758.  ('Records 21st Foot.')
</p>

<p>
Here the attacking force consisted of fourteen
battalions of infantry, with 600 provincials, and 300
artillery&mdash;13,094 men in all, under Major-General
Amherst.  The place was taken by capitulation, when
the garrison, which consisted of 5,637 men (including
the battalions of Volontaires Etrangers, Cambize,
Artois, and Burgundy), under the Chevalier de
Dracour, laid down their arms.
</p>

<p>
On the 24th of October, 1759, James Murray was
made Colonel Commandant of the 60th, or Royal
Americans, and at the capture of Quebec he served
as brigadier in command of the left wing; and after
the fall of Wolfe and surrender of the city&mdash;the
fortifications of which were in tolerable order, though
the houses were completely demolished&mdash;he was left
with a garrison of 5,000 men to defend it; while the
rest of the forces returned to Britain with the fleet,
which sailed soon, lest it should be locked up by
ice in the River St. Lawrence.  ('Ramsay's Military
Memoirs.')
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1760, Monsieur de Levi, at the
head of 13,000 men, took the field and appeared on
the Heights of Abraham, above Quebec, when Murray,
who had lost 1,000 men by scurvy, had but two
courses open to him&mdash;to march out and fight the
enemy on the old battle-ground, where the grave of
Montcalm still lay, or stand a siege within the ruins
of the city.  He chose the former, with equal spirit
and resolution, and coming out, with only 3,000
effective men and twenty guns (says the 'Military
Guide,' 1781), having to leave the rest of his force to
overawe the inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
His daring struck the enemy with surprise, when
he came in sight of them on the 28th of April, so
vast was the disparity in force!  He found their first
column advantageously posted on high ground covered
with trees, and their main body in line in its rear.
He attacked the first column with such fury and
intrepidity that it was hurled in disorder on the second
which, however, stood firm, and received him with a
fire so close and well directed that his troops
staggered under it.  The strength and weight of the
French force were such that his flank and even his
rear were menaced, and after an obstinate struggle,
with the loss of 1,000 of all ranks, he was compelled
to fall back, but in good order, behind the walls of
Quebec.
</p>

<p>
Undismayed, the ardour of his troops, who had
only salt rations to live upon, redoubled; and though
the French began to invest the city in regular form
on the very evening of their victory, it was the 11th
of May before their guns opened.  Murray had on
the walls 132 pieces of cannon, many of which he
was unable to handle for want of men; and with all
his bravery he must have been compelled to surrender,
had not the arrival of Lord Colville's squadron
in the St. Lawrence on the 15th, and the destruction
of the French fleet there by some of his advanced
frigates, so disheartened De Levi that he retired with
precipitation, abandoning all his provisions, stores,
and artillery, of which Murray instantly possessed
himself.
</p>

<p>
Montreal was the only place of any consequence
now held by France in Canada.  There General the
Marquis de Vaudrieul, governor of the province,
commanded all that remained of the French army; and
as a portion of General Amherst's plan for its
reduction, Colonel Haviland, of the 45th Regiment, with
the troops under his command, took possession of an
island in Lake Champlain, while General Murray, at
the head of all that could be spared from Quebec,
came by water to Montreal, which was attacked by
10,000 men, and capitulated in September, 1760, after
which the French lost all footing in America, the
operations in which were confined to Colonel Grant's
expedition against the Cherokees.
</p>

<p>
On the 10th July, 1762, Murray was gazetted
major-general, and in the following year was made
Governor of Canada, the conquest of which he
completed and brought steadily under British sway.  He
was made a lieutenant-general in May, 1772, in which
year we find him Governor of Minorca, with a salary
of £730, and Sir William Draper, K.B.,
Lieutenant-Governor, with the same allowance.  On the 10th
February, 1783, he was made full general.
</p>

<p>
The British Government, anxious to have a naval
station further up the Mediterranean than Gibraltar,
took possession of Minorca in 1708, and it was
confirmed to them by the Treaty of Utrecht, and
remained in possession of Britain till 1758, when it was
taken by a French fleet and army, after the failure of
an attempt to relieve it, which led to the tragic death
of the unfortunate Admiral Byng.  At the peace of
1763 Minorca was restored to Britain, but in 1782 it
was retaken by the Spaniards, after a defence by
General Murray which was deemed one of the most
brilliant military events of the age.
</p>

<p>
Long and narrow, it is thirty-two miles by eight
in extent, with Mount Toro in its centre, nearly
5,000 feet in height, and has two of the finest harbours
in the world, Fornella and Port Mahon, the latter of
which is defended by Fort St. Philip, on a rocky
promontory of difficult access from the land side.
</p>

<p>
Murray's garrison in Fort St. Philip consisted of
only 2,692 men, of which number, including the
51st Foot (under Colonel Pringle), only 2,016 were
regulars, 200 seamen of the <i>Minorca</i> sloop-of-war;
and 400 of these were invalids&mdash;'worn-out soldiers,'
as he states, sent from Britain in 1775, and all were
more or less unhealthy.  'The officers of the four
regular regiments,' says General Murray, in his
defence of himself, 'were in much better health than
the privates.  This is easily accounted for, for all of
them (viz., the British), for <i>eleven</i> years, lived on <i>salt</i>
provisions.  The quantity of vegetables they
consumed and the wine they drank, though it prevented
the immediate efforts of scurvy, could not hinder it
from tainting the blood.  The officers had, until we
were invested, lived entirely on fresh provisions, and
even after, that we were confined to the Fort, had
wine and other refreshments bought at their own
expense.  They likewise passed the day in the Castle
Square, and were only at night confined in the damp
air of the <i>souterreins</i>; but even the officers, with all
these advantages, began to be infected.'  (<i>Political
Magazine</i>, 1783.)
</p>

<p>
On Minorca being menaced by a siege, Murray
sent his wife and family to Leghorn, and, preparing
for a vigorous defence, shut himself up in Fort
St. Philip, for hostilities had now begun with Spain
(<i>Scottish Register</i>, 1794).  He scuttled and sank the
<i>Minorca</i> sloop-of-war at the entrance of the harbour,
to prevent the approach of the enemy's ships, and on
the 20th of August found himself blocked up by a
French and Spanish army, which landed in Minorca
without opposition, to the number of 16,000 men,
under the Duc de Crillon, who took his title from a
village of that name in the Department of Vaucluse,
and who subsequently distinguished himself at the
great siege of Gibraltar.  He was afterwards joined
by six French battalions from Toulon, under the
Count de Falkenhagen.
</p>

<p>
So resolute was the defence made by General
Murray, that the Duc de Crillon soon began to
despair of reducing the place, even with the vast forces
he had opposed to it, and secretly offered him (doubtless
by order of the King of France) the immense
bribe of one million sterling for the surrender of the
fortress.  Indignant at such an insult, he addressed
the following reply to the French commander:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
FORT ST. PHILIP, <i>October</i> 16, 1781.
</p>

<p>
'When your brave ancestor, so celebrated in the
"Memoires" of Sully, was desired by his sovereign to
assassinate the Duc de Guise, he returned the answer
that you should have done when you were charged to
assassinate the character of a man whose birth is as
illustrious as your own, or that of the Duc de Guise.
I can have no further communication with you, but in
arms.  If you have any humanity, pray send clothing
for your unfortunate prisoners in my possession; leave
it at a distance to be taken for them, because I will
admit of no contact for the future, but such as is
hostile to the most inveterate degree.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'Your letter,' replied the Duke, 'restores each of us
to our place; it confirms me in the high opinion I
always had of you, and I accept your last proposal
with pleasure.'
</p>

<p>
As ammunition was becoming scarce, on the 15th
of the same month the general issued an order that
cannon were not to be fired at single men, for the
younger officers of the garrison, becoming weary of
confinement, were wont to turn their guns 'at Bagats,
or figures dressed like men, which the enemy exhibited
in ridicule of our ineffectual firing,' and, curiously
enough, this order was one of the chief charges
brought against him, by Sir William Draper, at a
subsequent time.
</p>

<p>
By the 5th of February Murray's garrison, by the
ravages of inveterate scurvy, was so reduced, that only
660 men were fit for duty, and out of these 560 were
tainted with the disease.  'No words,' says Captain
Schomberg, in his 'Naval Chronology,' 'can paint the
heroic valour and resolution of the brave troops of
this garrison, which had to capitulate.'
</p>

<p>
'Such was the uncommon spirit of the King's
soldiers' (to quote the Hon. James Murray's
despatch), 'that they concealed their disorders and
inability, rather than go into hospital; several men died
on guard, after having stood sentry, their fate not
being discovered till called upon for the relief, when
it became their turn to mount again.  Perhaps a more
noble or more tragical scene was never exhibited,
than the march of the garrison of St. Philip through
the Spanish and French armies.  It consisted of no
more than 600 old and decrepit soldiers, 200 seamen,
120 of the Royal Artillery, 20 Corsicans, and 25
Greeks, Turks, Moors, and Jews.  The two armies
were drawn up in two lines, forming a way for us to
march through; they consisted of 14,000 men, and
reached from the glacis to George Town, where our
battalion laid down their arms, declaring that they
had surrendered to GOD ALONE, having the satisfaction
to know that the victors could not plume themselves
on taking a <i>hospital</i>.  Such were the distressing
figures of our men, that many of the Spanish and
French troops are said to have shed tears as they
passed them.'
</p>

<p>
His casualties were 108.
</p>

<p>
The Lieutenant-Governor of Minorca, Sir William
Draper, K.C.B., a famous officer in those days, the
conqueror of Manilla (who erected on Clifton Downs a
beautiful cenotaph to the memory of the Old English 79th
Foot, disbanded in 1763), thought proper, on the return
of the garrison to Britain, to accuse General Murray of
bad conduct during the siege, of profusion and waste
of money and stores, of extortion, rapacity and
cruelty.  On these startling charges, the general was
brought before a court-martial at the Horse Guards,
in November, 1782, the proceedings of which were
taken in shorthand by Mr. Gurney.  The President
was Sir George Howard, K.B., and among the
members was Lieutenant-General Cyrus Trapaud,
familiarly known as 'Old Trap,' the friend of Wolfe.
'In our attendance on this court-martial,' says a print
of the time, 'it struck us as an uncommon
circumstance, that although it was composed of very old
officers, and of long service, yet all appeared hale,
vigorous, and remarkably stout men, literally, to all
appearance, fit to carry a musket...  General
Murray appeared much broke, but had the remains of
a very stout man, he looked the old soldier!  Sir
William Draper looked exceedingly well, and in the
flower of his age.  His star was very conspicuous, and
his left arm always so carefully disposed as never to
eclipse it.'
</p>

<p>
General Murray was fully and honourably acquitted
of all the charges, save two that were trivial,
and for which he was sentenced to be reprimanded,
though he urged that his 'age and broken constitution,
worn out in the defence of Fort St. Philip,' were
such that he probably could serve his country no
more.  On the finding of the Court being communicated
to the King by the Judge Advocate, Sir Charles
Gould, he approved of 'the zeal, courage, and
firmness with which General Murray had conducted
himself in the defence of Fort St. Philip, as well as his
former long and approved services,' and the reprimand
was dispensed with.  His Majesty further expressed
his concern that such an officer as Sir William Draper
should have suffered his judgment to have become so
perverted as to bring such charges against a superior
officer.  The Court, apprehensive, from some
intemperate expressions made use of by the former to the
latter in a document, that the veterans would resort to
their pistols, prescribed a form of apology to be made
use of by Sir William, and to be acquiesced in by
General Murray; but this affair, which in its day
made much noise in the military world and in London
society, did not quite end here, as the general was
afterwards prosecuted by his countryman, Mr. Sutherland,
Judge Advocate of Minorca, for suspending him
in his office, and £5,000 damages were awarded
him&mdash;a sum for which he was reimbursed by the House of
Commons.
</p>

<p>
On the 5th June, 1789, he was made colonel of 21st
Royal Scots Fusiliers; and died on the 18th of June,
1794, at Beaufort House, near Bath, in Sussex, the
seat of Sir James B. Burgess, Bart., Commissioner of
Excise in Scotland.  In military circles he was long
remembered as 'Old Minorca.'
</p>

<p>
He left an MS. diary of his defence of Quebec,
which was in possession of Mr. Robert Blackwood,
publisher, of Edinburgh, in 1849, but appears never
to have been printed.
